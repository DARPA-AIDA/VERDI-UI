controversial new national security law.Hundreds of people have since been arrested in the former British colony since Wednesday.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hong Kong national security law is a decision adopted by the third session of the thirteenth National People’s Congress, to authorize the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) to promulgate a national security law in Hong Kong.The pan-democratic camp, human rights organisations and politicians abroad have criticised the decision as a threat to the 'one country, two systems' principle, the rule of law and civil liberties.</figcaption><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495Y0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are alarmed that arrests are already being made under the law with immediate effect when there is not full information and understanding of the scope of the offenses,' said the spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Rupert Colville.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are in the process of analysing the contents of the new National Security Law that was adopted on Tuesday very carefully in terms of its compliance with the international human rights obligations applicable to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),' Colville added.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spokesman specified that the UN High Commissioner is also concerned with the interpretation of Article 29 of the new law, which includes the crime of 'conspiracy with a foreign country or foreign elements to put on national security risk.'He opines that that can lead to a restriction of civic space and the ability of civil society to exercise their right to participate in public affairs, in addition to criminalizing human rights defenders and activists.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UN spokesperson also emphasized that the law must respect human rights, which the text explicitly recognizes, such as the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, the right to a fair trial, and other fundamental freedoms.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law, passed by the National People’s Congress of China (NPC), and whose content was hidden from the public until practically its entry into force, is Beijing’s response to more than a year of protests in Hong Kong.Those protests were initiated to challenge another law that aimed at facilitating extradition of residents of the former British colony to mainland China.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'One country, two systems' is a constitutional principle formulated by Deng Xiaoping, the Paramount Leader of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), for the reunification of China during the early 1980s.He suggested that there would be only one China, but distinct Chinese regions such as Hong Kong and Macau could retain their own economic and administrative systems.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam intervened by video conference at the UN Human Rights Council session, which is being held in Geneva, and defended this law.She assured those watching that the legislation does not question judicial independence or fundamental freedoms of Hong Kong’s citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law states that those who commit crimes of secession, subversion of state power (an accusation often used by Beijing against activists and dissidents), terrorist activities and conspiracy with foreign forces to endanger national security will be prosecuted.For these crimes, the legislation includes sentences of ten years to life imprisonment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The text is very controversial because it violates, according to its critics, the 'one country – two systems' principle.This is supposed to guarantee the ancient liberties of the former British colony, which are supposed to remain unique in comparison to other parts of China.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Security Law has been criticized by governments like the United States and the United Kingdom.The UK Government announced the granting of residence permits, and eventually citizenship, to about three million inhabitants of Hong Kong.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision increased tensions between London and Beijing, which accused China of violating the agreements reached for the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The jade miners were smothered by a wave of mud, which hit after heavy rainfall,' the fire fighters said.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the victims are said to be locals who sift through tailings in search of small bits of the semi-precious stone.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has been blamed for failure to take into consideration the unsafe conditions in the mining areas.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least 162 have been killed following a massive landslide in a jade mine in northern Myanmar.Firefighters said that they had recovered the bodies, and added that 54 people who had been injured were taken to hospital for treatment.They revealed that more people could still be trapped in the mud.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kachin State is the northernmost state of Myanmar.Kachin State has Myanmar’s highest mountain, Hkakabo Razi (5,889 metres (19,321 ft)), forming the southern tip of the Himalayas, and a large inland lake, Indawgyi Lake.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The jade miners were smothered by a wave of mud, which hit after heavy rainfall,' the fire fighters said.It is considered the jade mining industry’s worst ever disaster.It surpassed a 2015 accident that killed 113 people.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the victims are said to be people who sift through tailings in search of small bits of the semi-precious stone.'All the casualties are local jade scavengers,' the firefighters added.'The miners were collecting stones when a muddy wave caused by heavy rain buried them.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rescue operations are still ongoing although the process has been made difficult by the fact that heavy machinery could not be used in the area.It is alleged that the people had been warned against going to the mines due to the heavy rains.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, Myanmar’s Gem Enterprise had ordered jade mining companies to suspend their operations for three months beginning this month due to the heavy rains experienced during the monsoon season.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video footage showed helpless miners racing uphill in an effort to escape the heap of mining waste that cascaded into a lake burying many other miners.A witness said that he was about to take a photo of precious mound that he felt was about to collapse when he heard people shouting.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Within a minute all the people at the bottom just disappeared,' he said.'I feel empty in my heart.I still have goose bumps . ..There were people stuck in the mud shouting for help but no one could help them,' he added.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade refers to an ornamental mineral, mostly known for its green varieties.Jade is featured prominently in East, South and Southeast Asian art, but also has an important place in many other cultures.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has been blamed for failure to take into consideration the unsafe conditions in the mining areas.'The government should immediately suspend large scale, illegal and dangerous mining in Hpakant and ensure that companies that engage in these activities are no longer able to operate,' said a statement from Global Witness, a London based environmental watchdog.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres sent his condolences to the families of the victims and the government, adding the UN was ready to address the needs of the affected population.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedy occurred in Kachin State, which is the center of the world’s jade mining industry, and is about 600 miles north of Yangon, the country’s largest city.In 2014, Myanmar’s jade industry was estimated to be worth $31 billion.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deadly landslides are a common occurrence in the poorly regulated Hpakant area in Kachin state.Most of the residents here make a living through jade scavenging.When taking power in 2016, the government of Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Laureate, had pledged to clean up the mining industry, but nothing much seems to have changed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
