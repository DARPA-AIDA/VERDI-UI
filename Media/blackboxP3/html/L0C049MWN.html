Lurie, a former FDA associate commissioner, said the group was 'very glad' that FDA warned Dr. Mercola.The group wrote a series of letters to agencies with oversight in July 2020 highlighting a number of Mercola’s claims, and similarly testified before a U.S. Senate committee about alleged COVID-19 scams.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to SimilarWeb, Mercola.com is the No.1 site in terms of global traffic in the Health: Alternative and Natural Medicine category, and had more than 5.7 million site visits in February 2021.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the three webpages at Mercola.com specifically flagged as problematic by FDA were still available on the site at press time (here and here), and continued to contain claims language that the agency said runs crosswise with the law.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their response letter, Mercola lawyers cited a body of clinical research, especially as it relates to 'strong evidence surrounding vitamin D,' and further quoted Dr.Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who previously suggested taking vitamin C and D supplements because they can lessen 'your susceptibility to infection.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also requested a meeting with FDA’s chief counsel, and similarly asked that FDA publicly back what they said has been scientifically proven with regard to vitamin D.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We urge FDA to follow the science and immediately issue a well-crafted health claim that informs American consumers to work with their physician to determine their vitamin D levels and start a plan of vitamin D supplementation to reduce their risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19,' the company’s statement detailed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It continued, 'Americans should utilize everything in their arsenal to reduce their risk, including nutritional approaches that are often pennies a day to help stem the tide.'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-03-16T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Duffy Hayes</p></p><p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C049MWQ.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-03-16</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-08</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C049MWN</p></body></html>
