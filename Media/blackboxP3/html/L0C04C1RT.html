misinformation campaign from Chinese media attempting to pin the blame back on the accuser.(...jBefore getting too carried away with apportioning blame, perhaps the west could take a look at itself.The Spanish Flu, according to some historians, originated in Kansas.Ross River Virus originated in Queensland, Australia.Idealistic it may be, but in this moment it doesnâ€™t matter where coronavirus came from.Itâ€™s here now, and the only way that weâ€™re all going to get through this is by banding together, rather than splitting apart and throwing people â€“ whether a single cyclist, or an entire country â€“ under the bus in the interest of political point-scoring.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That first bit is nonsense.Chinese state media were already spreading disinformation about an American origin back when Trump was still in denial.</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also nothing racist about naming a virus after the place where it first rose to prominence, as evidenced by your own examples.Throw in the Mexican flu, Hong Kong flu, and the West Nile virus and you've got examples from just about every continent.Wuhan virus would have been in line with historic naming convention and arguably clearer than using the generic name coronavirus.</blockquote></p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-27T03:51:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

areas.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H1N1 wasn't called Kansas Flu for instance.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-27T04:06:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

critics who pointed this out.It wasn't an entire area that has a culture of suppressing the truth and lying to its own people.Nor it is an entire area that has imprisoned millions of people with a different ethnicity and religion than the majority, or which has engaged in overt policies of cultural annihilation through forced resettlement and other programs and pogroms.It is the Chinese government.Maybe we could all be smart and realize that China (the geography) is an amazing place, and Chinese people are probably as good and bad as any other people on the planet, but the Chinese government is a bunch of sociopathic narcissists whose way of governing and initial handling of the virus has made Covid-19 into a much more catastrophic event than it might otherwise have been.Since when do facts 'stigmatize'?If somebody finds a fact stigmatizing, they probably shouldn't have done that thing in the first place.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

government.Call it Xi's Disease.But 'Chinese' is neither useful (as the experts and scientists have given it a name, why not use that name?)nor terribly opaque.It's very clear why some people are stressing the 'Chinese' part.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-27T17:59:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>TomJ</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fucking morons, the lot of you.Just go and repeat well proven fucking bullshit.When the United States 2009 H1N1 swine flu emerged, it eventually infected 60 million people in the US and killed a minimum of 18,449 cases worldwide that year.But the final story of the H1N1 global pandemic was far worse than that, with close to 300,000 deaths, according to the final tallies in 2012 reported by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Which is why I am scratching my head at how bizarrely negative forces are attacking China and Chinese people as it engages a remarkably aggressive front addressing this Corona virus outbreak which started in Wuhan, central China.I am forced to ask and answer a few questions.During 2009 H1N1 outbreak, I don't recall xenophobic anti-America attacks across the globe, do you?In fact, do you recall it took six months for the U.S. to declare a national emergency?Did any government from the onset in April 2009 through the end in April 2010, including the month of June, when H1N1 was declared an international emergency global pandemic, then send out a notice to its citizens that they should leave the United States?Close their borders to American travelers?Nope, not a peep.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I said, something's not right, folks.I am reading hateful vicious attacks on the Chinese government for their supposed intentional conspiracy to intentionally under report the number of infections, yet that is exactly and always the case with such flu outbreaks no matter what country and the CDC reports illustrate that crystal clear.The U.S. H1N1 swine flu numbers were vastly underestimated and updated three years later, because dear friends, that is the nature of such viral outbreaks which don't care which country they started in.There is never enough man power, there are never enough test kits, there is never enough medicine or medical supplies.China is not trying to hide these hardships, they are well known, they are being reported on the news daily in China.There are always people who die, thousands of them whom we'll never know if they actually died because of a particular virus.Those are the facts, not any problem unique to China's healthcare system or government.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its not a conspiracy, its just tragedy.https://www.linkedin.com/wu...</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-29T00:18:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Munix</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, thanks for that diatribe and for swearing at me.For the record, if you reread what I said, I'm not calling it a conspiracy.My problem with the Chinese government is that they were jailing and silencing the doctors who were reporting on this 'new disease'.And underlings in Xi's government were not passing the truth up the chain of command, because they were afraid for their own jobs as well.This all happened.It's not a 'conspiracy', it's a totalitarian state doing totalitarian things, things that had they not done them, would have helped dramatically.Xi didn't do it as some vast conspiracy to infect the world or something.He did it because he's a dictator, and that's what dictators do.And because Xi runs his government like he does, they missed their window to cut this thing off before other nations had to.And now other nations are doing things poorly as well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that's my beef with the Chinese government.Thank you once again for calling me, what was it, a 'fucking moron' for simply claiming that Xi had a lot of responsibility in all of this (not for claiming conspiracy, as I did not claim that).What do you call someone who calls someone else a moron after reading in all sorts of incorrect assumptions into their post?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You really are charming, showing off your intellect by being unable to engage in a discussion without trying to verbally abuse people.It really helps your arguments, really shows that *you* are the rational one.Good job.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-29T10:27:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

shouldn't obfuscate the responsibility the Chinese government bear in its spread (as you detail quite clearly and simply below).In an era of untruthiness, remembering the facts and clearly articulating them is important.So thank you.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-29T12:03:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

they were investigating the first 7 patients, dickhead.They didn't hide anything, and announced the findings really quickly fuckwit, in record time to any other outbreak you fuck'n moron fact.Go fact check first you moron before spreading miss information.March 28, 2009 first case H5n1 child in southern california.No public mention for 3 weeks that's longer than n-Corona in China.The first school closed in 3 weeks the same time as China closing the Market.The virus was identified about 8 days later than China, the first confirmation was 2 days later than China, The epidemic centre was opened about 3 days later than China, and not much else happened, whereas China went into a huge response, and people cooperated.China was giving free treatment to flu symptoms, rolled out infrared sensors to airport, railway stations, coach stations and passenger terminals.While the US didn't really do anything, Time magazine saying it was too late to do anything anyway while Mexico began a massive lockdown, closing public spaces, stadiums, theatres and public spaces, their Army giving out face masks.The US was not really doing any action and the President says H1N1 'not a cause for alarm'.This lack of action causes the virus to spread to Canada, Spain, UK, the CDC declines shutting borders down ignoring potential to spread internationally, the reason 'it won't help less Americans get cases' what about the rest of the World you inconsiderate pricks.The US transportation secretary says 'It is safe to fly' encorouging people.The CDC suggests schools should re-open.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-29T00:17:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Munix</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time to shine a light:

On the other hand, it's not difficult to imagine the US government trying to economically or politically destabilize a foreign country.Only in the last few years they've done it in Venezuela, Bolivia, Brazil, Iran, Yemen ...Now, with China they cannot use the same methods due to the political structure and economic power of this country.A country wide pandemic is not such a bad idea, it's cheaper than bombs and certainly more efficient in this case with a very low potential of retaliations.Don't tell the US wouldn't do such a thing involving so many potential civil deaths in China.They don't have any problems when it involves bombs or sanctions.They don't even care about the health of there own people.It's more important to them to bailout private corporations than to stop the pandemic in the country and support their citizens.Now it could hypothetically be a wicked idea that went wrong.BTW, when it comes to propaganda, no countries beat the USA and their mainstream media.When I read some of the comments here, the mindset of some people are not far from this conspiracy theorist.They're willing to believe anything that suit their way of thinking.It's only the other way around when it comes to who are the good and the bad guys.But whatever the hypothesis, if your not providing sufficient proof then that's just that, an hypothesis.However, I'm quite sure many Americans wouldn't listen even if there were some disturbing facts requiring further investigation or wouldn't even believe it if it was proven.Just look at how many people reacted to the Lance Armstrong case.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW The title 'Well folks, you wonâ€™t believe whatâ€™s being pinned on cyclists now' is a cheap click bate.2nd These conspiracy theory is 'pinning it' on a US military who happens to be a competive cyclist.Stop the tribalism.It's not as bas as conspiracy theories but it's still bad 'journalism'.Because in the end, it's still an 'US VS THEM' point of view.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-27T16:50:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Krazyfrenchkanuck</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lol.'I'm definitely not a conspiracy theorist but ...' |conspiracy theory|</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-27T17:56:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>TomJ</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're proving my point.People select the information that fits their narrative.And I presume your not a fan of Noam Chomsky.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-27T18:31:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Krazyfrenchkanuck</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noam was fine when he was a linguist, had some really innovative things to say about language acquisition.When he started not making sense I stopped paying much attention to him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your point is just that people have biases when they hear or read things...that gets a bit lost in your conspiracy mess above.But if that is in fact your point--okay.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-27T19:15:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>TomJ</p></p><p><p><img src='../png/L0C04C1S3.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C1RV.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../svg/L0C04C1RX.svg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C1RW.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C1RY.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C1S5.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C1S6.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C1S7.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C1S0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C1RZ.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;n/a</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-13</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04C1RT</p></body></html>
