commentary)</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicotine may bind with the ACE2 receptor, particularly in people with COVID-19, and thus could interfere with further SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 binding (pre-print in silico study)</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicotine and cigarette smoke decrease levels of ACE2 in multiple organs</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cytokine storms could be prevented or suppressed by nicotine through its impact on the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system; nicotine may inhibit hyperinflammation and platelet reactivity</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor COVID-19 outcomes in people who smoke could be driven by nicotine withdrawal when acutely ill, thus nicotine patches 'should be urgently considered and discussed' (note, nicotine patch use in hospital is a common approach across conditions)</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France has had to place restrictions on sales of nicotine replacement therapy because of fears it may start to be stockpiled for inappropriate use relating to COVID-19.Studies are underway testing nicotine replacement therapy in COVID-19 patients, and until results are available from those, there is no evidence to support the general public’s use of nicotine replacement therapy for COVID-19 infection.Nicotine replacement therapy is a mainstay of smoking cessation treatment and is safe and effective in this capacity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSIONS</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are biologically plausible pathways through which nicotine may impact SARS-CoV-2, but the clinical significance of these is entirely unclear</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early studies are underway regarding the role of nicotine replacement therapy as a therapeutic aid for COVID-19</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence so far is too limited to inform any decisions about use of nicotine replacement therapy in COVID-19</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When used for smoking cessation, there is high certainty evidence that nicotine replacement therapy is safe and effective.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclaimer: the article has not been peer-reviewed;
