Covid-19....risky</h1><p>Obesity &amp;amp; Covid-19....risky</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that there is a direct relationship between Obesity, and those who are dying from this pandemic.This should be a wake up call to those who are overweight, as this virus and its 'Variants' will probably be an issue for quite some time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.yahoo.com/news/obesity-driving-factor-covid-19-145033591.html</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-03-05T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

equation.Racists blame Asians, Hispanics, Blacks illegal aliens for Covid.They'll just pick one group they hate the most blame them for whatever the disease of the month (or year) is.Ignorance abounds.And people who want to feel better about themselves don't have a weight problem will blame overweight people - 'They did it to themselves.'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

distance as being forced to do so in public places that require it to help protect vulnerable people.Those who don't practice transmission prevention are punishing vulnerable people by making the world more dangerous to them and also forcing them into further isolation by not helping create the least dangerous public environment possible.I consider that very selfish of them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition those people are also increasing the danger to everyone because every person who is infected by the virus gives us another chance for a mutation to develop which could increase the danger to everyone.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-03-05T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

continuing education is funded by pharmaceutical companies they know where the profit is.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40 years ago, I saw 5 doctors at 405 lbs.Each one gave me advice that ranged from useless to ridiculous.One doctor I never met helped me lose 235 lbs.(Dr.Joel Fuhrman) who wrote a book called, 'Eat to Live.'In my photo, I'm at 185 lbs.I'm at 165 now haven't gained an ounce in 12 years.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-03-05T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>win231</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what they say and I'm fat.My job also has put me inches from Covid patients, I've been diligent at work and have had both vaccines.Haven't worked directly with Covid people in some time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My weight gain started at 8 from childhood abuse.Nobody cared then.They were discussing nicotine addiction on the radio the other day and stated it's harder to quit than crack.I have actually heard it compared to heroin also.I smoked when young and quit when young.Smoked about 6 years.I was able to kick that.Food is a lifelong battle.It's so ingrained as my comfort and solace, I've never been able to change it.And how I have tried.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-03-08T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Remy</p></p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruthanne said: It's

though one therapist told me my childhood was 'un-survivable.'My mother was mentally ill.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not in the mood for putting up with people anymore.I've known for years that you can beat your spouse and kids, kick your dog and if you look good when you walk out the front door, society will treat you better then me.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

these days.The apples we buy are 2 dollars plus a pound.In some cases, the five dollar or four dollar fast food options can supply two meals in a day.High calories so you gain weight.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I became obese, I did not over eat, I ate poorly.I ate what we could afford.I have lost weight these last few years due to eating better food, and stomach issues, not dieting.But the fact that I lost 25 pounds while taking prednisone is worrisome to my doctor.25 pounds lost by an obese person who is not dieting or trying to lose weight is not good.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iâ€™ve never smoked, never drank, and generalizations, fat shaming, and presumptions that overweight people willfully don't take care of themselves by other people displays a certain amount of ignorance by the accuser.IMO.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-03-08T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

diabetics are either type 1 which has nothing to do with weight, or there is a genetic component.There are a lot of diabetics in my family.I totally agree with @Ruthanne.My weight is my business.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be my ideal weight I need to lose 30 more pounds, but if I do, the doctors want to start tube feedings which I will not do.Meanwhile I just try and not regain what I have lost so I watch what I eat, and I eat 2000 calories a day.But at my doctors visit on Friday I gave up 8 tubes of blood.She wants to know why I am losing weight.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

wasn't my intention to offend anyone.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not exactly skinny and have been known to eat a lot of crap -- especially when I'm feeling depressed or pissed off about something.I've also had problems with drugs, alcohol, and used to smoke.In other words, I didn't take very good care of myself and am sometimes surprised that I'm still alive after all the abuse my body has taken, so my comment was from my own self-destructive behavior.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-03-08T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
