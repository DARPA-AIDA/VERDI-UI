it is highly likely that the company was in some form of trouble due to its ties with Chinese organized crime figures.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese organized crime figures have ties with technology companies that make high-tech equipment.It is known that these Chinese organized criminals are stealing intellectual property.Should the Chinese company be allowed to market products that assist these criminals?This is definitely a serious issue that needs to be looked into.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiaomi Corp is hardly alone in this fight.Many other companies that use the Chinese labor force to work in America have also been in the cross-fire.This all comes back to the question of free-market capitalism, and the ability of the government to protect its citizens from bad guys who want to take advantage of free markets.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-31T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Doris Mkwaya</p></p><p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y3.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04D9SW.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04D9T1.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04D9T2.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495XV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495XW.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495YA.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495XU.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y8.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495Y0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y2.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495YE.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495Y7.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-01-31</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-07-08</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04D9SO</p></body></html>
