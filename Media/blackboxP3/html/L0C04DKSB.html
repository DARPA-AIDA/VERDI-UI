Best Numbing Agent Around?</h1><p>Why is Numbify Rated the Best Numbing Agent Around?</p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04DKSI.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its no secret that Numbify has gone viral.We believe that through practice and test our numbing cream, gel and sprays are by far the best on the market.The real question is, what is Numbify’s secret to success?What exactly makes Numbify the best numbing agent on the market?</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numb-ify is a deep penetrating formula delivering 5% lidocaine when numbing is needed for fast and strong relief of pain and itching.In side by side testing, Numb-ify has been shown to be the most powerful numbing formula on the market.Numb-ify 5% lidocaine numbing is a deep penetrating anesthetic numbing liquid gel packed with as many natural ingredients as possible, that’s designed to significantly reduce extreme topical pain.</figcaption><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495XV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To truly answer that question, we need to really dig deep into the product formulation.Numbify is unique in many ways, but one of the truly unique things about Numbify is that they are a hybrid of natural remedy and science driven medications.The active ingredient in their products Lidocaine is a well known and highly proven anesthetic.Lidocaine has been around for over 75 years, and is the numbing agent of choice for tattooing, hemorrhoids, bed sores, and a variety of other topical pain and itch relief needs.Lidocaine is stable, and effective, and with the right delivery agent, it can be targeted precisely where its needed for maximum numbing effectiveness.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we delve even further into the ingredients that make Numbify great, it’s important to remember that even though Numbify uses natural ingredients, that doesn’t mean that natural is always better.When building a medical product you should use the best available components regardless of whether they are natural or not.Numbify is committed to using natural ingredients as often as possible, but that means that sometimes a synthetic ingredient is a better choice, and then and only then does Numbify use a synthetic ingredient.They never make that choice based on cost effectiveness, or to make their lives easier, they only do so if its the right choice for the right reasons.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numbify the Best/Strongest Numbing Pain Relief Cream, Spray, and Gel.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When many companies choose their ingredients they choose the cheapest ingredient that will barely get the job done.That is the main difference between Numbify and the other brands on the market.Numbify selects the best, regardless of cost.Which makes you wonder, If Numbify’s ingredients are more expensive, and their products actually cost less, what exactly are you paying for when you buy the other guys?(Hint: It’s probably the fake reviews that they are paying to make their poor quality products look better)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now so far we have gone through the natural and active ingredients, and these are the main ingredients that make the products work.There are others that are used to make the product into a cream, or gel.(The spray is these products and only these.)The cream and gels do have a few synthetic stabilizing ingredients such as Carbomer to gel or thicken the cream, as well as Triethanolamine with changes the ph of the gel so it thickens with less Carbomer, reducing the need for this synthetic, and leaving more room for natural ingredients.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tested Numbify 5% Lidocaine cream against major competitive brands and believe Numbify is not only strong but has many healthy natural ingredients such as Kava and available OTC.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask you to try our products and judge for your self.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on
