White House said that the President had declared a major disaster in Texas and had called upon federal agencies to offer resources.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Texas was greatly affected by the bad weather and most of the residents were forced to stay under boil water notices following the freezing temperatures.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other residents have also been forced to have a clean-up operation due to the extensive damage caused by the heavy snowfall.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports indicate that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has shipped generators and supplies like blankets, fuel, and water in the affected areas.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the disaster, the federal government has already approved emergency declarations for Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm is said to have killed 29 people, a huge number of single weather-related deaths.More than seven million people suffered electricity blackouts and water disruptions.Governor Greg Abbott said that Texans should not see extremely huge energy bills because of the strain on the energy market due to the tragedy.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg Abbott is an American attorney and politician serving as the 48th and current governor of Texas since 2015.A member of the Republican Party, he served

the storm, the state has started experiencing water systems recovery.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boil water notices have also been lifted.Residents who are faced with long-term damage will have their problems fixed since the state will organize to have plumbers fix the broken pipes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extreme winter weather did not spare businesses.Retailers and restaurants were shut and their employees sent home.FedEx said that the horrible weather halted operations in one of its hubs, in Memphis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter storm, which brought with it freezing rain and snow,
