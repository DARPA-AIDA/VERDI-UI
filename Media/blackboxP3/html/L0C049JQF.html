95% CI, 0.73-0.92;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.001).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the patients who were vaccinated, 4% tested positive for COVID-19 compared with 4.9% of nonvaccinated individuals.This association remained significant after the investigators controlled for baseline covariates (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68-0.86;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.001).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the investigators found that vaccinated patients had lower odds of requiring hospitalization (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46-0.73;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.001) and mechanical ventilation after hospitalization (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.27-0.78;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= .004).They were also more likely to have a shorter hospital stay (risk ratio [RR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.001).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no significant differences observed for mortality or use of intensive care units.However, this may have been due to the small sample size and low number of deaths during the study period.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigators noted that the observed protective association between the influenza vaccine and COVID-19 may be impacted by socioeconomic factors and the implementation of school closures, mask mandates, stay-at-home orders, and lockdowns shortly after the first positive case of COVID-19 was detected in Michigan March 10, 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Discrepancies in adherence to these guidelines between influenza vaccinated and unvaccinated patients could bias the observed association.A prospective study accounting for these differences is needed to explore the possible protective effect of the influenza vaccine on COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes,' wrote the investigators.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the reduced COVID-19 risks in vaccinated patients may be due to bias from a healthy patient population that is more likely to receive preventive therapies.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the investigators noted that there is a 'hypothetical, yet plausible immunologic mechanism' associated with influenza vaccines that could result in trained immunity, where a vaccine results in an adaptive immune response that can be activated in response to a nonspecific antigen, such as how a particular tuberculosis vaccine has shown to be effective against yellow fever and malaria.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Even if the direct link between the prevention of COVID-19 and the influenza vaccine is minimal, through an overall reduction in the number of patients presenting to their providers with viral-like symptoms necessitating work up for COVID-19 or requiring hospitalization for complications of influenza, vaccination will preserve health care resources for those with COVID-19,' wrote the investigators.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitations of the study included that the patients and data were specific to Michigan and mostly collected from large hospitals, not community settings.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Until the COVID-19 vaccine becomes widely available, the influenza vaccine should be promoted to reduce the burden of disease during this pandemic,' the investigators said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conlon A, Ashur C, Washer L, Eagle KA, Hofmann Bowman MA.Impact of the influenza vaccine on COVID-19 infection rates and severity.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am J Infect Control</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Published online February 22, 2021.doi:10.1016/j.ajic.2021.02.012</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-02-24T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Skylar Jeremias</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C049JQH.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-02-24</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-08</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C049JQF</p></body></html>
