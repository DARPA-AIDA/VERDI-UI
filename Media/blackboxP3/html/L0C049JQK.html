95% CI, 2.25-8.33;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.001) and modality of oxygen delivery during hospitalization (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.08-2.61;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= .02).Female sex (OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.11-6.55;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= .03), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 5.52; 95% CI, 1.32-23.08;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= .02), and intensive care unit admission (OR, 5.76; 95% CI, 1.37-24.25;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= .02) were identified as risk factors associated with D</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLO</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less than 60% of expected.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, 53.8% (n = 128) of patients were identified to have some degree of functional impairment at follow-up.Limited mobility was identified in 53 patients (22.3%) based on Short Physical Performance Battery scores.All of the other patients underwent a 2-minute walk test, which revealed that an additional 75 (31.5%) patients had a smaller degree of impairment in exercise capacity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COPD had an association with increase physical impairment risk (OR, 12.70; 95% CI, 1.41-114.85;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= .02) and higher D</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLO</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was associated with a decrease physical impairment risk (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.98;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.001).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, 21% (n = 50) reported that their exercise tolerance had worsened after COVID-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, 17% of the overall study population had some degree of clinically relevant PTS symptoms, as determined by results from the Impact of Event Scale-Revised questionnaire.However, 25.6% (n = 61) of patients had mild PTS symptoms, 11.3% (n = 27) had moderate symptoms, and 5.9% (n = 14) had severe symptoms.Male sex was the only independent factor associated with moderate to severe PTS symptom incidence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigators noted that contacting only hospitalized patients with COVID-19 may be a limitation.The high proportion of discharged patients who declined to participate may have generated a selection bias and distorted the real proportion of patients still experiencing functional or psychological sequela.Also, the psychological evaluation was limited to PTS symptoms and may not have captured the full extent of the psychological COVID-19 impact.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellan M, Soddu D, Balbo PE, et al.Respiratory and psychophysical sequelae among patients with COVID-19 four months after hospital discharge.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JAMA Netw Open</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Published online January 27, 2021.Accessed March 16, 2021.doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.36142</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-03-17T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Skylar Jeremias</p></p><p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C049JQM.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-03-17</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-08</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C049JQK</p></body></html>
