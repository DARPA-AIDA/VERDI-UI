'the theory that life is being spread across the universe on fast-moving asteroids and comets'.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CORONAVIRUS, A BAT BORNE VIRUS?</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The theory that it jumped from bats via snakes to humans is implausible,' the researchers said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, findings had revealed that the coronavirus had emerged in a sea-food market in China's Wuhan.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the research paper points out that 'many cases of disease [about 30 per cent of case reports] arose in locations unconnected with the Wuhan seafood and meat market'.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper further said that the initial explanation that Covid-19 jumped from bats (possibly via snakes) to humans and then spread via human-to-human contact is 'at odds with the data at present'.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'THEORY IS UNLIKELY'</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theory is unlikely -- an astrobiologist, Graham Lau, had told Space.com in an interview.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling the theory as an 'extraordinary claim', Lau said that even though the idea is interesting, 'we just don't have any reason to embrace' it right now.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lau explained that there might be a reason to investigate the possibility of extraterrestrial origins of the virus 'if this thing had some different kind of biomolecule in it that's different from life as we know it'.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even in that case, there could be Earthly explanations, Lau said.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHO SAYS CORONAVIRUS IS NATURAL IN ORIGIN</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the conspiracy theories, the World Health Organization (WHO) has maintained that the novel coronavirus is 'natural in origin'.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Ryan had earlier said that WHO teams have listened 'again and again' to many scientists who have looked at the gene sequences and the virus, 'and we are assured that this virus is natural in origin.'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-10-10T19:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Akriti Anand</p></p><p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-10-10</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-13</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04C3L9</p></body></html>
