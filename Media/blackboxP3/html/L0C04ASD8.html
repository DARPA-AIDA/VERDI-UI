standards ending</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayor Joe Hogsett announced that the city will not yet ease business restrictions once the statewide coronavirus health standards end April 6, maintaining capacity restrictions at bars and restaurants throughout Marion County even after the NCAA tournament ends.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capacity for indoor dining at restaurants will stay at 75%, while bars and gyms will stay at 50%.Those capacity limits were eased just ahead of the NCAA tournament, allowing businesses to stay open until 2 a.m.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our population is equal to the population of the 45 least populous Hoosier counties altogether,' Hogsett said on Thursday.'That's quite a disparity, that's quite a difference in terms of density and contact.And while we're moving in the right direction as far as our positivity rates and other important indicators, the threat of an uptick is not yet behind us.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indy masks to stay:Mayor says Indianapolis will retain mask mandate despite governor ending statewide version</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling pressure:Gov.Holcomb says Legislature pressure didn't end Indiana's mask mandate.But there's tension</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A bad move':Health experts say Gov.Eric Holcomb is ending Indiana mask mandate too soon</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marion County had been in the least-restrictive 'blue' category in the state's county-level restrictions, which classified counties as red, yellow, orange and blue based on their community spread rate.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the county has still played it relatively safe, imposing capacity limits for restaurants and bars and adopting a face mask mandate well ahead of the statewide order.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We want to encourage people to feel comfortable to go indoor where appropriate over these next few weeks,' Hogsett said.'But we need to have people wear masks, we need to have restaurant ensure that they're going to be socially distanced.We need to practice good hygiene.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outdoor dining can remain at 100% capacity, while retail stores are open at 75% capacity.Social gatherings are limited to a maximum of 50 people unless organizers file a risk mitigation plan with the health department.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Movie theaters, bowling alleys, and other entertainment businesses are at 50% capacity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement follows Gov.Eric Holcomb's decisions to lift the statewide county-level restrictions and the mask mandate beginning April 6, leaving local governments with the decision on whether to keep them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Holcomb has felt strongly that cities, towns and counties should have the ability to restrict businesses and require masks, not everyone in his Republican party agrees with him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State lawmakers has tried to curb Holcomb's executive power following his response to the pandemic.The heavily Republican state legislature which is still in session, could move to strip the city of its power and lift restrictions.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hogsett said he trusts that lawmakers appreciate the fundamental differences between Indianapolis and the rest of the state.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I believe that the Indiana General Assembly understands that,' he said.'I trust their judgment, and I just ask them and have reason to believe that they will trust our judgment.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Virginia Caine of the Marion County Public Health Department equated the efforts to a race, one that residents have not quite finished.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach that finish line, Caine said, Indianapolis must reach a few data-driven measures: 70% to 80% of the population should be vaccinated to reach herd immunity, the positivity rate should stay at 5% or less for three weeks, and the number of cases on a seven-day average should be 35 cases or less for two weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roughly 12% of the population in Marion County aged 16 and over is currently vaccinated, according to the state's dashboard.Marion County figures show that people age 70 and above are vaccinated at the highest rates, above 50%.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caine said she hopes to reach herd immunity by this summer.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the county's seven-day positivity rate stands at less than 3%.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call IndyStar reporter Amelia Pak-Harvey at 317-444-6175 or email her at apakharvey@indystar.com.Follow her on Twitter
