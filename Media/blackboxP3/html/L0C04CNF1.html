short of having the ability to and then pursuing a complete eradication and country isolation policy, the pandemic will go through the population no matter what you do.If you tamp down the first wave, the second wave will be worse, such that you end up with the same cumulative deaths for no gain.And often worse since the second wave overwhelms hospitals like it did in Czechia, and you need more extreme restrictions to cope.The US had: - Europe level deaths despite far worse preexisting conditions in USA than Europe or Canada.- FAR better economic outcomes; they've crushed Europe - FAR more personal freedom The US has done far better than Europe in how this has played out.So your take that 'people died in the US who didn't need to' doesn't seem to be based on reality.What should have been done differently and what would the outcome have been in terms of whole-pandemic deaths + economic damage?</p><p><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenge trials, obv.</td><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-17T14:02:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Howard Treesong</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about european failures don't excuse sandbanks failure?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-17T14:08:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>rickroll</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100% agree on challenge trials.But again, like private sector tests, it was the experts and their institutions who blocked or wouldn't even consider challenge trials.That's 100% on them.Leaders had nothing to do with that.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quote:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally Posted by Cuepee Tooth now resorting to the 'nothing anyone could do would have mattered.It was always going to be this bad.Thus not Trumps fault'.WHich he does not understand means it then invalidates his criticisms of the 'experts failing poor victim Trump'.This while Tooth holds to the view that Obama really screwed this up by not refreshing the PPE and at the same time, in the 3+ years later no one can or should blame Trump for not refreshing the PPE as it was up to his experts to refresh that or tell him, so it is the experts fault and not Trumps.Again so as Trump empowers his State Department to ship tons of PPE to China, the friggin country who manufactures most of it proving supplies are so low they need to pull it back from other countries... As the WHO is screaming PPE shortage is critical and our biggest challenge... Trump has bare cupboards, knows he has bare cupboards, authorizes his State Department they can ship tons of PPE back to China...But in Trumps tiny pea brain NONE OF THIS is a wake up call that 'oh sh*t maybe I should try and do what those charities are doing and take control of all the PPE in the US to restock our cupboards' instead of just letting the charities get it all and shipping it to China for them.Nope for genius Trump that thought never occurs.And as a Texas firm who makes PPE is begging all through that time through its conduits to the Trump admin to help them ramp up their production of PPE with guaranteed orders, the Trump admin ignores them exasperating the problem.But, no, pea brain Trump could not have done a single thing differently.He was perfect at every stage.FLOL.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeating for the fifth time debunked Facebook memes is getting a bit sad, Cuepee.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump had nothing to do with the private charity shipping their privately obtained PPE to China.Plus it happened all over the world, the UK government itself for example (not private charity, the government) sent PPE to China.At the time expert opinion was mostly that it would blow over like SARS 1 did; that's on the experts, not on the leaders.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolding and BOLD CAPPING your irrelevant hottakes like an obsessed angry loser clown is even funnier.All you're doing is proving my contention that you're quite mentally ill.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're also proving that you can't answer my question and in fact I am correct.17 tons of PPE is utterly irrelevant, it would be used up in a few days.The UK had large stockpiles and ran out in no time, with shortages everywhere.Read this, for example: Why a billion items of PPE is not enough.The world had a PPE production capacity problem that wasn't going to be solved for over a year; stockpiling some once it was underway made no difference to deaths.And indeed; there was nothing to stockpile; China controlled most of the supply chains thanks to Bush and Obama era policy, and were hoarding it for themselves, as were other countries.3M was bought out months in advance by US hospitals and states.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So an example you cite where Trump could have made a difference had he even known about (seizing a private charity's private trivial holdings) would have made no difference to deaths.Beyond that, PPE is barely relevant for deaths.It doesn't work well, especially over time as doctors and nurses get cumulative exposure.They get it eventually and recover; you've gained nothing in those cases.</p><p><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know whether you're so mentally unwell with Trump hate that you don't realize you you just made my point for me, OR if you're

failures.Why?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hungary, Czechia, Croatia, Slovenia etc nailed the first response.I was in Croatia during the first wave for example, and was thoroughly impressed with a highly competent response which contained the spread.Epidemiologists broke the regions into subregions, isolated them, controlled their local areas, put control orders on the affected and their contacts with harsh fines and compliance checkups.They made the rest of Europe look like amateurs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did those same leaders, epidemiologists, country characteristics that nailed wave 1 - ALL of them without exception - have such horrible results in wave 2 such that they not only caught up from far behind but surpassed in death rates?Do we praise the leaders and bureaucrats for wave1 and blame them all - the same people!- for wave two?Did they all go from far better than Trump to worse than Trump?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality it seems that pandemics run their course no matter what you do.If you contain wave 1 well then wave 2 is worse such that your cumulative death is the same or worse.The evidence is right in front of you in that across vastly different communities and first wave responses.They all turned out the same.If you do not fully isolate your country, close all borders in perpetuity and eradicate, all of your measures are largely pointless and result in the same outcome over the life of the pandemic, PLUS greater economic and personal damage from those measures.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only caveat being that your death rate will be higher if you do not stop hospitals from overwhelming completely, but apart from that, and as long as you do that, nothing you do - masks, restrictions, stuff closed or open - matters.The evidence for this is overwhelming at this point.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is why the Texas/Florida response has been so much more intelligent despite being screamed at by the losers in the left wing press (left wingers have a poor grasp on reality, which is why they're left wing).Texas check up after full opening early March to the screams and howls and ill wishes and finger wagging from the left wing

there is a critical shortage and they are in need of this.China's cupboards are now bare.- and to know 'Obama left our cupboards bare...bad Obama'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet still be stupid enough to not wake up and say 'oh sh*t maybe we should take all this as a cue to restock our own shelves.Maybe we should do what the charities are doing and gather up all the available PPE in the US

differently.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is calling for 'seizing'.That is a strawman of your own making.He could have however did exactly what the charities were smart enough to do and acquire it

did a better job in FL with Covid than Cuomo or Newsom did in NY or CA.And that was with less restrictions and lockdowns.So I think the common idea that red states handled it worse than blue states is changing, even among some liberals.DeSantis also followed the common sense strategy of just opening up vaccines to everyone over 65 first.Which makes so much common sense it almost boggles the mind that so few states followed it.Let's vaccinate 25yo prisoners and smokers before senior citizens!</td></p><p><tbody>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left wing response on Twitter is that DeSantis/FL fudged the numbers.I don’t think that is true but it is out there.</tbody><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-17T18:32:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

and let everyone else carry on as normal.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-17T18:37:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>bobbyJ</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well,

have some hard data, for the UK variant at least:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quote:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Danish study from the Statens Serum Institut published on March 2, tracked positive cases detected by PCR tests from January 1 – February 9.It found that the risk of hospitalisation from infection by the UK variant rose by 64% in general, and 84% for people aged under 30.In the UK, research on the variant by Imperial College London and Exeter University was presented to the UK government body the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory (NERVTAG) on January 21.Researchers unanimously found that the UK variant was more dangerous, but disagreed on the extent, finding between 29-91% higher likelihood of death among those infected by the variant, depending on the research.</p><p><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the new variants are worse for the young.A lot of the reporting is due to vaccines (as the older gets vaccinated, the average age drops) but there's something real here as well.In Brazil vaccination rates are near non existent but the young are increasing in hospitals.</td><p><strong><i>Posted On:

developed blood clots and they were both severely overweight.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-17T21:12:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

Brazilian variant which might be a bit nasty.Even though younger people seem to get hospitalised, it makes me wonder what the real percentage is.I still must know around 20 people who caught Covid, older people too and with some health conditions, but not one hospitalised.Anyway, Israel seems to be doing outstanding.Many vaccinated and are now starting to relax things there.My problem with the UK government is that we have flights landing from India everyday and the double variant in India which might get through the vaccine, we are not sure, although maybe the vaccine can at least offer some protection.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quote:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally Posted by PuckFokerGo Is anyone aware of data on who is getting blood clots from the vaccines?For

mind.Without going into details I’ve heard from Drs that they believe the threat is way overrated.</td><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-17T21:22:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
