the option of self defense then any criminal that chooses to make a citizen in that category a victim feels safe to do so.Make sense?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

firearm.Federal law has, since 1934, prohibited convicted felons from owning or possessing a firearm or ammunition.We know you are clueless and we know that criminals don't care about laws.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>lonestarlizard</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's right.Look at all the criminals in Chicago for example.Do you think a criminal is going to go to his local gun shop and buy a gun?no he's not because he knows he can't.So the criminals will get someone else to but the guns for them.That's just the way it works.Politicians know this.But they want to take the guns away from the law abiding citizen so the criminals can run 'free'.Look at all the mass shooting that goes on in Chicago every weekend.But it is never reported that they are mass shooting.Mass shooting are done by a person who is either mentally unstable or has bone to pick with someone, or is pissed off at his old employer.But what the 'despicable liberal press' will not report that 'its people that kill people'.You can kill someone with anything.Look at all the stabbings, you don't see government trying to ban knives do you?no you don't.When people are armed criminals will stay away from you, because they now know they are on a level playing field.But when your not armed they have the advantage.Politicians like when criminals have the advantage, they back the criminals but not the victims that they kill.Politicians see criminals as the victims, the people that are shot and killed they see them as 'collateral damage'.That's how law enforcement is in the United States.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

they believe they can get away with it.If every citizen owned and kept a firearm with them at all times, criminals wouldn't dare commit crime, we would only see a fraction of the crimes we do today.How many rapists or pedophiles would there be if every potential victim and their family members had guns at the ready?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every person on Earth has the right to life until they forfeit that right through their actions.If someone decides to walk down the street and point a gun at your head in order to kill you, do you not have the right to kill them to prevent your own death?Of course you do.That person forfeited their right to life when they tried to take your right to life from you.Now should the government be able to tell you that you can only use a knife to defend yourself against the man with the gun?No, that would be the same as the government telling you you must just roll over and die.Government doesn't have the right to take your life anymore than the guy with the gun.The right to bear arms is an extension of the right to life, we can defend our own lives any way we see fit.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

crazy.But maybe that is his desire.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see Matthew, we have gun laws restricting people convicted of a felony of owning a firearm.So by using liberal illogical thinking, the convicted rapist or pedo will never have access to a firearm as that is illegal, correct?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using conservative logic I will assume if someone is deranged enough to harm another person they will obtain a weapon illegally and therefore I will keep my firearm ready to defend myself if this person crosses paths with me.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

criminals to have firearms fight even harder to make sure their intended victims are unarmed.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Bob Cascadden</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no explicit language in our constitution that mentions exceptions for being denied a fundamental right.But congress, and individual states can, under their respective constitutions, pass laws that infringe on our fundamental rights.Then the courts come into play, deciding whether the law(s) violate such rights.That has been going on for over 232 years.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>lonestarlizard</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'shall

</i></strong>Bob Cascadden</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not what I was responding to.My reply was to your question wanting to know why felons are denied firearm rights.You do have a point; there is no 'exception' mentioned relative to the 2A.But, as I pointed out to many here many times, congress can, and does, pass firearm laws.The GCA of 1968 contains the language denying felons the right to own a firearm.It has not been overturned by SCOTUS.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-13T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>lonestarlizard</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress violating the US Constitution and having those violations supported by the Courts does not negate the fact that 'shall not be infringed' means exactly that.Those words were included because the Framers of the US Constitution did not see any justification for denying someone their Right to keep and bear arms.If they saw a reason, the words 'shall not be infringed' would not have been included.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-13T15:58:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Bob Cascadden</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not disputing your point.Take a clue and let the bloviation go.There are 3 branches of our government; ever hear of checks and balances?The constitution is the supreme law of the land.The same document gives congress power to pass laws.The same document gives the judicial branch power to negate unconstitutional law.The words in the constitution mean something but congress, courts and the executive tend to ignore many of those words on a routine basis.Get over it.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
