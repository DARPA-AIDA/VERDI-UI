irritate Xi by stopping travel.Democrats destroyed the economy by shutting down states.This was a ploy to get the liberal useful idiots to burn down their own cities.How stupid are liberals to think this is a good tactic?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infrastructure bill is pay off the liberal states for destroying their state economy so Trump would be blamed for a bad economy.Had the liberals had not destroyed the economy there would be no need for the infrastructure bill.biden and the liberal policies are killing jobs faster than the liberal democrats can redistributed money from working Americans to the illegals that biden is letting invade America.The covid cases are going up because of the open boarders policies.Why is biden causing covid cases go up?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

crying about making sure a voter is who they say they are, registered in ONE AND ONLY ONE PRECINCT and an citizen of the US.Where is the Jim Crow laws that Biden keeps 'crowing' about...where is the racism that the Democrats keep blaming on the passage of the bill, Catch phrases, false flagging as voter suppression.Its always the same response when you ask them for specific objections.Even here
