Dollezhal Scientific Research and Design Institute of Electrical Power Engineering Technology in Dimitrovgrad.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is on track for completion by 2020.The MBIR is a 150 MWt sodium-cooled fast reactor and will have a design life of up to 50 years.It will be a multi-loop research reactor capable of testing lead, lead-bismuth and gas coolants, and running on MOX (mixed uranium and plutonium oxide) fuel.NIIAR (Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation) intends to set up on-site closed fuel cycle facilities for the MBIR, using pyrochemical reprocessing it has developed at pilot scale.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major difference between the two reactors is that MBIR is designed for the traditional uranium oxide petroleum and VTR is designed for the metallic alloy fuel.The metallic alloy fuel can produce a higher neuron stream vs oxide, but oxide is ceramic and has withstood the capabilities of the nuclear expansion.Nevertheless, metallic alloy reactor fuels are gaining large interest.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Russia is the world leader with a 22% global market share of nuclear installations using Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation designs.Thus far, over 600 research reactors have been constructed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be fascinating to observe the nuclear race between the US and Russia over the next two decades.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2019-08-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Christina Kitova</p></p><p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y3.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C04EPKL.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C04EPL3.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C04EPL4.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04EPKI.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495XV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495XW.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495YA.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495XU.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y8.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495YI.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y2.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495YE.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495Y7.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2019-08-10</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-07-09</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04EPKC</p></body></html>
