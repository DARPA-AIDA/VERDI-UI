pandemic.For months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended the practice of staying at least six feet away from other people in public, otherwise known as social distancing, to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.The general principle is that close contact is the primary way COVID-19 is transmitted via respiratory droplets from an infected person who sneezes, coughs, or merely talks to others.However, social distancing is not just a recommendation in many states—some are enforcing this safety practice by law.Want to be sure you're staying safe and not coughing up money?These are the states that could fine you if you are not social distancing.And for more states with serious ramifications for violating COVID-19 precautions, check out the 7
