but that still isn't the example I asked for and is very different from the federal government taking already delivered items from the state.Heck, taking charge of items in progress would be lawful under interstate commerce, even if I might disagree with it.Its an entirely different thing--both legally and otherwise--for the federal government to seize already delivered and stored goods from a state.And if the federal government had the power to seize it by law, 'hiding' the goods wouldn't stop them.Again, I see this as a paranoid blue state governor.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

it's not about outbidding, but instead that the government took the already paid for supplies away before they reached the place they were headed.(Try using that in court.'Your Honor, he hadn't made it home with his computer, so I didn't really steal it.')Plus, it's happening in blue states, so everything's copacetic (even though it's happening in red states too–but they are secretly blue states because they aren't in lockstep with Trump).Got it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, my head is spinning from all that!</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

didn't.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I wrote:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quote:</p><p><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally Posted by prospectheightsresident Tell me of one case where the federal government has taken PPE supplies ordered and delivered by states I've heard of cases where the federal government has essentially outbid states for PPE orders and taken delivery itself of

custody).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there is clear constitutional authority under the interstate commerce clause for the federal government to seize things in transit.But that is very different from the federal government seizing property that has already been delivered and is in the state's custody.Again, you have failed to provide such an example.Hogan's response--supposedly out of fear of something that has not happened--appears to be that of a paranoid blue state governor with zero basis in law or practice to fear such an action.</p><p><tbody>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You providing the earlier example showed that the efforts of the federal government went beyond what I had heard.It did not rebut my position of there not being cases of the federal government seizing PPE shipments ordered and delivered by states.</tbody><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-01T12:48:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

keep any medical supplies they have paid for with state funds for themselves.It all equals out.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-01T16:16:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

or incompetent to put a national procurement/supply chain in place and abdicates all responsibility for the states - outright telling the states they are on their own and they need to get their own supplies...When the states DO find and order supplies and they are en route, it's fine for the federal government to re-route them and then dole them out to whomever is in favor that day - leaving states high and dry.Why, on earth do the Feds need the supplies if they are not in the supply business and are not delivery clerks?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice you said the shipment was paid for by the states and in transit.... did the government reimburse the state?I'm betting not.</p><p><table>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a pitiful excuse for a government THIS is.</table><p><strong><i>Posted On:

constitutional authority or not, it was wrong.There was no reason for Jared's minions to take supplies that were headed to states, especially since the states weren't refunded.And it's not like those stolen supplies are being redistributed where they are needed most.Instead, they went to Jared's personal stockpile.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like Governor Larry Hogan 'trumped' the shoplifters though with the 'Larry Hogan Don't Like Thieves Act'.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-01T19:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
