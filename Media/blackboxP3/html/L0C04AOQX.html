$20.10) tests in October,3 with plans to perform regular tests in the hope of picking up asymptomatic cases 'across hospitals and care homes, to test patients and residents yet more regularly to help keep people safe, and for schools and universities so we can keep education open safely through the winter,' as England’s health secretary, Matt Hancock, said at the time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From January 2021 the Department for Education will encourage schools and colleges 'to conduct weekly testing—this will help identify those who are carrying the virus without displaying symptoms, reducing the risk of transmission,' as well as 'daily testing for those identified as close contacts of workforce colleagues, students or pupils that have tested positive.'1</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the lateral flow test for picking up asymptomatic cases is not one of the manufacturer’s intended uses.Instructions supplied with the test state that it is 'intended for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid antigens from SARS-CoV-2 in human nasal swabs or throat swabs from individuals who are suspected of covid-19 by their healthcare provider within the first five days of the onset of symptoms.'4</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A preprint published on the Department of Health and Social Care website on 11 December by the University of Liverpool analysed test accuracy data from a two week trial in the city, concluding that the Innova test had a sensitivity of 48.89%.5 This led to the Liverpool Health Protection Board pausing its plans to use the Innova tests to allow visitors access to care homes, although it later resumed confirmatory PCR testing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A department spokesperson told</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BMJ</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 'The country’s leading scientists rigorously evaluated the lateral flow test and confirmed the accuracy of the tests using a sample of over 8500.Latest figures for similar settings show sensitivity of 57.5% generally and 84.3% in people with high viral loads.This means they are accurate, reliable, and successfully identify those with covid-19 who don’t show symptoms and could pass on the virus without realising.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With up to a third of individuals with covid-19 not displaying symptoms, broadening testing to identify those showing no symptoms will mean finding positive cases more quickly and break chains of transmission.Anyone who tested positive with a lateral flow test during the university testing earlier this month would have been asked to get a confirmatory PCR test.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a statement Innova Medical Group said that it was unaware of the dataset from Birmingham and the Scottish universities.It added, 'The low level of efficacy being suggested is not something we recognise, suggesting a careful and considered examination of the methodology used would be advisable.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This low level of efficacy is not achievable in any manner where the test is used properly and sample collection is taken correctly.When used properly the Innova test is a highly effective tool in detecting infectious people and allowing for proper response to assist in the reducing of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is made freely available for use in accordance with BMJ's website terms and conditions for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic or until otherwise determined by BMJ.You may use, download and print the article for any lawful, non-commercial purpose (including text and data mining) provided that all copyright notices and trade marks are retained.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-12-23T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Stephen Armstrong</p></p><p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04AOR1.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../svg/L0C04AOR0.svg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-12-23</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-21</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04AOQX</p></body></html>
