often the floor if not impeded.The latest research has shown this tendency to be the case in terms of COVID-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to understand how to use gloves, and think through the process each time they wear them, however.And each situation general</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-20T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Cynthia Kellam</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.If not worn properly and while following appropriate infection control guidelines, masks and gloves are not going to do a whole lot to prevent you from acquiring coronavirus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** This may be an extreme example, but I’ve seen people out in public wearing masks like this.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there have been several healthcare workers who, despite wearing the proper personal protective equipment, have been infected with the coronavirus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some common mistakes people make when wearing masks and gloves:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masks are being worn too long - Ideally, masks should be changed every 2 hours or viral partic</li><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-20T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Guy D McCardle, Jr.</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you wash or sanitize your hands frequently, you should be okay.But wearing gloves is not a bad idea; I have thought about doing that has well.The down side is that anything your gloves touch that may be contaminated can transfer the contagion to another surface unless you remove and replace your gloves frequently.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, the simplest thing to reduce your risk is to maintain social distancing, wear a mask, avoid touching your face and eyes, and wash or sanitize your hands as much as you can.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the safety profession, we prefer administrative controls over the use of PPE, which masks are.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-20T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Michael Huff</p></p><p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-04-20</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-21</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04ASS0</p></body></html>
