fiction of a 'border crisis'.After labeling the fake crisis 'Biden's Border Crisis', we are finally realizing that it is not getting traction due to lack of evidence.So, we are winding it down with a fake story that says Mexico is taking care of it, so that when people point out that there is no crisis, we can all give credit to the Mexicans instead of President Biden.Man, this is too easy!</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-14T17:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Trump2020pollsarefake</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't lie....My dad wants
