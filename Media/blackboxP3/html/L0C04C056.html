precautions and making the same decisions these experts have been making.Like Connell (?)said, I have a history of breast cancer so I'm not missing my yearly mammogram.I haven't gone to the dentist, but I went to the OB because I had a medical issue and HAD to be seen.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've gotten take out and eaten outside, but not inside.Masks inside, but not outside like the experts are doing, no flying (obviously) and everything else they're doing I'm doing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for sharing.I was worried maybe I was being a little blase about it, but I feel much better.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-03T18:09:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>GreyhoundGirl</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was very interesting, thanks.I loved the personal explanations.The scientists validate a lot of what I’ve come to believe (or believe at this very moment in time).</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

surprised that none of them would visit the doctor...and it's making me rethink at least one of my upcoming visits.of course, i made all my maintenance appointments 1.5 months ago when we were at 20 cases a day....now we're at 200-400 a day!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i got the dentist and optometrist both in and have the obgyn next week--really want to go to that one since i've now officially reached menopause....i've got a mammogram scheduled, but maybe i'll cancel that since no family history/no issues/had one a year ago... and then i have the dermatologist scheduled and would really like to make that one since i'm outside a lot in the summer....we'll see when that comes closer.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-03T18:25:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

pretty safe place since they know all about disease control.I went in for a procedure (botox for migraine).They had all the chairs in the waiting area spaced out.Plexiglass between you and receptionists.100% mask requirement for patients and staff.I felt very safe.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-03T18:41:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

their personal lives with Covid precautions.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something that has bothered and concerned me was very evident in their comments though.They all said they would not eat indoors at restaurants or be in closed spaces with other people because they would be breathing each others air.Hmm, this description fits a classroom too - a room full of people you don't live with for an extended period of time all breathing the same air.Some talked about the importance of getting kids back to school and how younger kids may not be as affected by or even carry the virus, but not once was there any consideration given to the adults who teach in these schools and classrooms.They did recognize the risk to older high school and college age students though.Teachers are not working in full PPE like doctors and nurses are when patients come to the hospital or clinic.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-03T18:54:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>all41</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for sharing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel better about having our cleaning ladies come every other week.DH sleeps in his office and I head outside while they are here.Then I wipe all doorknobs, cabinet pulls, light switches with a Clorox wipe and wash all the linens after they leave.I’ve also started opening up the windows to air out the house.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve been to my gyn.for my annual, which had been postponed from late March.My doctor has asthma and is older so she closed down for a couple of months because she was in a higher risk category.I figure she’s doing all she can to stay safe, which means I would be safe there.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All41 - that’s been bothering me with all the conversations about sending students back.No one mentions the risk to the adults on campus.One even mentioned the risk of a child exposing parents to the virus.If that’s a concern then why are teachers and support staff not part of the conversation.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-03T19:03:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>MissTrace</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says I have to subscribe to read the article.Can someone tell me what it says about doing an exercise class?We are spread out, but it is inside.Thanks!</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

with students is</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;considerably</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more inside exposure then is recommended.Telling that they think it's not okay to spend an hour at a restaurant where you are nowhere near other tables/waitstaff is wearing a mask, but it's okay to have 30 people in a classroom right next to each other for 7 hours.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week when I had a friend visiting (she'd been isolated too) we ate at several restaurants.I felt very safe as other people were nowhere near us and the staff wore masks.Numbers are still good here but they're so bad almost everywhere else that I'm starting to get more nervous again.I had thought about going back to one of the places we went by myself- not something I normally do, but the food is</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amazing</i><table>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the place is 30 minutes away/I don't think the food would travel well.I'll probably stick to take out for now.</table><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-03T19:28:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Haley23</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;storytime85, it didn't specifically say anything about exercise classes.Here's the part about gyms, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quote:</p><p><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: Would you go work out at a gym?Swim in a pool?Run?Walk?Fauci: I wouldn’t go to a gym.I need to be so careful.I don’t want to take a chance.I have a pool at home, so I swim in that.I do power-walking with Chris.I was running until about a year ago, but every time I went running, my back would tighten up the next morning.So now I walk the same distance.It just takes longer.We go every day with few exceptions, 3.5 miles per day during the week, four miles over the weekend.Prior to covid-19, I did it at lunch alone in the parks near NIH.Now, I do it in the evening with Chris around the neighborhood.On the weekends, Chris and I do it together on the C canal.Connick: I wouldn’t go to a gym.I’d go to an outdoor pool, which is much safer than an indoor pool, since everything dissipates in the air, although I wouldn’t go to a crowded outdoor pool.Volberding: I had a gym built in my house before this and it has everything, so I have no need to go to a gym.But I wouldn’t go eagerly.They can’t disinfect everything all of the time.As for pools, if anything, outdoors yes, indoors no.The swimmers would need to be far enough apart.There is a lot of heavy breathing, so even if they are in the next lane, I don’t think it’s fully safe.I try to get out and walk most days.Bell: Of these I would only run, walk or hike where there were few other people, making it easy to avoid close contact.Bloom: I’m on the treadmill every other day at my house.I belong to a gym, but don’t believe gyms are the safest place to be until the numbers go down.Swimming outside itself is pretty safe — but stay out of the locker rooms.Satcher: I’m not a gym person, even when there is no pandemic.I have to be outside.Being outside is good for you.I still run and walk, although I walk more than I run.I go about three or four miles most mornings.I would swim, since there is no evidence it is spread in water.I would only swim outside, since I am not an indoor swimmer.</td><p><strong><i>Posted On:

there are different levels of caution even among the medical experts shows the science is still evolving.It’ll be awhile before we know everything we need to about this disease</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-03T21:04:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>PoohBear</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04C05M.png'
