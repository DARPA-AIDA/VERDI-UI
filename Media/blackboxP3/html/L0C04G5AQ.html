coronavirus vaccines attacking women’s reproductive health as a form of population control</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisement</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All over the world, reports of the adverse effects of experimental Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines are emerging.A number of these undesirable effects are exclusive to women and include menstrual problems like heavy bleeding, miscarriages and low breastmilk production.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, five American doctors have come forward to discuss why many women are experiencing these problems after getting vaccinated, and why coronavirus vaccines are not really vaccines, but rather bioweapons designed to control the population.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critically Thinking with Dr. T and Dr. P</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;webinar, hosts Dr. Sherri Tenpenny and Dr.Larry Palevsky were joined by Dr. Christiane Northrup, Dr. Carrie Madej and Dr.Lee Merritt in a truthful discussion about what is going on with these so-called vaccines and how they are affecting women worldwide.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenpenny and Palevsky are leading medical voices against vaccination.Palevsky, a former president of the American Holistic Medical Association, is an advocate of holistic health practices for children and adolescents.Tenpenny is the author of four books opposing vaccination.She is also against the use of face masks as a mitigation tool against COVID-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their guests in the webinar are all well-versed in the field of vaccines and how they negatively affect people’s health.Northrup is an expert on women’s health and is one of the leading voices warning against the negative effects of coronavirus vaccines on women.Madej is one of the most vocal critics of mRNA vaccines, which she says can change people’s DNA.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Merritt is a member of America’s Frontline Doctors, a group of medical experts that have been warning the public against allowing the government to coerce them into getting vaccinated.Merritt also advocates against lockdown measures and says their negative effects on mental health may cause more harm than the coronavirus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the webinar, the five doctors discussed how the 'vaccines' are not what they say they are and explained why many women are experiencing unpleasant side effects.They pointed out that thousands of women around the world have reported their negative experiences with coronavirus vaccines, but the mainstream media has not reported on these.Instead, the media has focused only on blood clot issues.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctors also shared stories from women they know, including their own friends and patients, who’ve received the vaccine and observed changes in their bodies and their reproductive health.In addition, they drew attention to reports that even unvaccinated women who have been around those vaccinated seem to be experiencing these side effects.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With how these so-called 'vaccines' attack women’s reproductive health, the doctors brought up the possibility that these experimental shots are not really vaccines but bioweapons designed to help reduce the world’s population.(Related: EXTERMINATION machine

rollout began, the mainstream media has focused only on blood clots as the primary side effect of COVID-19 vaccines.It has largely ignored the vaccines’ effects on women’s reproductive health.But recently, reports of the latter have become so prevalent that they’ve become hard for mainstream media to ignore.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late April, after reporter Kate Larsen asked about it on social media,</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ABC7News</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reported being flooded by stories of women experiencing menstrual cycle changes following vaccination.Since then, many women have continued to express concern about long and heavy periods and changes in cycle timing following vaccination.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These reports underscore the fact that, according to data, women are generally experiencing more side effects than men.Last month, the</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(CDC) published a study that analyzed safety data based on the first 13.7 million COVID-19 vaccine doses given to Americans.Despite the fact that only 61.2 percent of the vaccines have been administered to women, a whooping 79.1 percent of the reports about their adverse effects came from women.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the side effects that women reported experiencing were more severe.These included body aches, chills and fatigue, aside from flu-like symptoms.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But experts at the CDC said that women experiencing these side effects is to be expected.According to Julianne Gee, a medical officer in the CDC’s Immunization Office, women 'have more reactions to a variety of vaccines.'These include flu vaccines given to adults and vaccines given to children, such as for hepatitis and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDC experts cited a 2013 study that found that four times as many women as men, aged 20 to 59, reported experiencing allergic reactions following inoculation with vaccines for the 2009 flu pandemic.They also point to another study that found that, between 1990 and 2016, women accounted for 80 percent of all adult anaphylactic reactions to vaccines.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, the fact that these studies exist and that women are supposedly more susceptible to side effects raises questions.If this was already known, why wasn’t more effort made to lessen the side effects on women?Or was this knowledge simply treated as a 'fact of life' so as to normalize extreme side effects on women and their reproductive health any time a new experimental vaccine is released on the market?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more on how so-called COVID-19 vaccines are actually doing more harm than good, visit
