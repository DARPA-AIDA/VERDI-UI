side of the ocean and they must be held to account.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as for who is safe and who is not, we‚Äôve already caught the bug, survived it, and have a supply of zinc vitamin D and

that ivermectin is cheaper and safer by many orders of magnitude than these dangerous experimental vaccines that are killing so many people?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivermectin also is a broad-based

it did to the worlds economy even though it has a 99.9% survival rate.All they needed was a highly contagious virus to start spreading to control peoples minds.The deaths came easy by way of the elderly where in American the average age of death by Covid is 75.This was calculated.The rest of the younger deaths are just normal anomalies.Then when you add in CDC misinformation though their 'covid related' death numbers, you have what appears to be a very deadly virus.Why else would they force the world to wear CLOTH masks to protect them against a virus?A virus particle is about .3 microns.Its like pouring water through a strainer.Sure there will be some water on the inside of the strainer, but that doesn't make the strainer and effective umbrella.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

theories.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science journalist Tara Haelle described the video as propaganda and posited that the video 'has been extremely successful at promoting misinformation for three reasons':</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- It 'taps into people's uncertainty, anxiety and need for answers'; -- It 'is packaged very professionally and uses common conventions people already associate with factual documentaries'; and -- It effectively exploits various methods of persuasion, including the use of a seemingly trustworthy and sympathetic narrator, appeals to emotion, the Gish gallop, and 'sciencey' images.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing for the Deseret News, journalist Amy Iverson stated, 'I understand many of us are confused and feel helpless and hopeless at times these days.We want someone to blame.But we cannot turn to outrageous, unchecked claims from a few loud voices to ease our concerns.And we definitely should not spread their unsubstantiated claims.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Gish gallop is a term for a technique in which a debater attempts to overwhelm an opponent by excessive number of arguments, without regard for the accuracy or strength of those arguments.Using a Gish gallop, a debater confronts an opponent with a rapid series of many specious arguments, half-truths, and misrepresentations in a short space of time, which makes it impossible for the opponent to refute all of them within the format of a formal debate.In practice, each point raised by the 'Gish galloper' takes considerably more time to refute or fact-check than it did to state in the first place.)</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-14T07:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>‚Üê Face of Trump Style

from Wuhan, China.Two doctors who attempted to warn the public early on about COVID on Chinese social media were Dr. Ai Fen and the late Dr.Li Wenliang.Rather than work to stop the spread immediately, the Chinese Communist Government disciplined both of the doctors.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Government made it difficult - in many cases, probably impossible - for journalists to cover news on the early spread and severity of COVID.When citizen journalists, such as Fang Bin and Chen Quiushi, began leaking reportage on the outbreak to the international community, Chinese Communist authorities arrested them.The anti-'misinformation' campaigns on social media, including on YouTube in the US, started around that time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the Chinese Communist Government realized what a problem COVID was; but by then, they missed their opportunity to nip it in the bud.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the Chinese Communist Government in the wrong?To a degree, I would say yes, although clearly other factors came into play in the international community, as well - especially once the virus escaped China.If the Chinese Communist Government had permitted the information to circulate and considered the possibility that it may have been accurate, it is possible that the spread may have ended up slowed or reduced.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, did this virus come from a lab?It is possible.Do we know for sure?No.We don't currently have enough evidence make a definitive claim either way.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does any of this make it okay for us to mistreat people who are Chinese or Asian?No, although not wanting to be near such individuals was understandable, out of concern for public health - in the early days of the pandemic.I think the issue more than anything is putting things into perspective.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any rate, that's my perspective as a white Trump Conservative who has been to China; speaks some Mandarin; has had Chinese friends; and would rather promote good will among people, including the Chinese people and Chinese-Americans.=
