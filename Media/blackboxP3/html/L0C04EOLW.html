said:</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Justice has not forgotten these brave U.S. Air Force veterans and their families.It is an honor and privilege to fight for justice and compensation for these

said:</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is certainly an honor to represent these veterans and their families in holding Iran accountable.The massive explosion took so much from their minds and

tower.'</blockquote></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iran’s media also covered the news, claiming that the allegations made by the federal court in Washington were baseless, and that this action was part of the US government’s efforts against the Iranian government.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted
