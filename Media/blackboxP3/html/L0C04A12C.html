omission are worse that lies by commission For example, under Trump, job openings exceeded people unemployed for the first time since the government began reporting the data in 2000.That remained the case for 24 consecutive months, most with over 1 million more job openings than people unemployed, a record that may never be matched.As a result the unemployment rate consistently hit 50-year lows with a record or near record lows for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, women, people with only a high school education, the handicapped, and veterans.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the demand for employees high and the supply low, yearly wage growth hit 3 percent or better for 20 consecutive months, a record streak in the data going back to 2007.As a result, 2019 saw median family income rise a record-high 6.8 percent to a record-high $68,700 while the poverty rate decreased a record high 1.3 percentage points to a record low 10.5 percent lifting over 4.1 million people out of poverty As for income inequality, it decreased in 2019 for the second year in a row.So much for Harwood‚Äôs claim that Trump failed to close the gap between 'the beleaguered blue-collar workers' and the economic elites.Harwood based that claim, in part, on his belief that the rich 'benefitted disproportionally from [Trump‚Äôs] tax cuts.'It‚Äôs a good talking point, but also just wrong.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-13T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Arizona Conservative</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you get your so

omission are worse that lies by commission But, under Trump and before the pandemic, the number of people employed rose to an historic high of nearly 159 million or 6.6 million more than when he took office.Due solely to the pandemic lockdowns, by April that number dropped precipitously by over 25 million people to 133.4 million, the lowest number of people employed since 1999.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with this crisis, Congress and the president acted quickly to protect American workers and businesses.When Congress was unable to act due to partisan divisions, President Trump acted on his own.As a result, while we are still in the midst of the pandemic, we are also in the midst of the most dynamic jobs recovery in U.S. history.The economy has added back over 16 million jobs since April, a historic high for any seven month period.To give the jobs numbers some perspective, the economy added a total of just under 10 million jobs during President Obama‚Äôs entire eight years in office, seven-and-a-half of which were post-recession.A historic high in the number of people employed followed by a precipitous pandemic induced decline and a historic recovery -- all within seven months -- paints a rather impressive portrait.Harwood then argues that Trump‚Äôs 'record offered little legitimate grounds for boasting before the pandemic.'To make that statement, you have to ignore not only the largest number of Americans ever employed but an extensive amount of additional impressive, often record-setting, economic data.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-13T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Arizona Conservative</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy was in the process of losing 712,000 jobs per month when Obama took Office, on it's way to losing 8 million jobs.The economy had been gaining 212,500 jobs per month, for the past 48 months, when Trump took office.There were more people working than ever before the day Trump took office.From the bottom of the recession, black unemployment dropped 9%, from 16.8% to 7.8%.Hispanic unemployment dropped similarly.Black unemployment dropped an additional 1% in Trump's first year, hitting the record Trump likes to take credit for.The 50 year unemployment low of 3.5% was hit, Not because of an astronomical number of jobs being created, but Because the work force was nearly depleted when Trump took office.The unemployment rate dropped just 1.2% under Trump to hit that 50 year low.There were 2,188,000 jobs created in Trump's first year, the Fewest since 2012.With the aid of the tax cut, there were 2,300,000 jobs created in 2018, and 2,140,000 jobs created in 2019.You are right when you say Trump's administration created 6.6 million jobs before the pandemic.Obama's administration created 8.1 million jobs during his last 3 years.AGAIN, Obama's administration reduced the 1.4 trillion dollar deficit they inherited by more than half, while pulling out of the worst recession since the great depression.With the 'Greatest economy ever' (alleged by Trump), Trump pushed the deficit to over a trillion and added 3 trillion to the debt BEFORE the virus.Again, Trump was a disaster, relative to the economy.Please pick out and repost a lie in my post.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
