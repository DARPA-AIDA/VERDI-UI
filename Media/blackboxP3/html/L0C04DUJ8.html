for the demonstrations was the announcement of new taxes on, among other things, telephone calls through voice services over the internet.Political parties and the rest of the population reacted immediately.Just over 24 hours of protests have put the Lebanese Government between a rock and a hard place, and have led Prime Minister Saad Hariri to give a 72-hour ultimatum to political parties to resolve the country’s economic crisis.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saad Hariri is a Lebanese politician who has been the Prime Minister of Lebanon since December 2016.He was also the Prime Minister from November 2009 to June 2011.He is the second son of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, who was assassinated in 2005.</figcaption><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y2.png'

messaging platforms on the internet.Protests in Beirut spread to other cities in the country.So far, at least two people have died and several dozen have been injured in demonstrations that have led to emergency meetings throughout the day.Hariri also made a televised address to the nation on Friday.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There are those who have placed obstacles in front of me since the government was formed, and in the face of all the efforts that I have proposed for reform,' Hariri said.The response of the government partners must be 'explicit, concrete and final, which convinces me, the Lebanese, the international community and all those who express their anger on the street today,' he said.'Whatever the solution, we no longer have time and I am personally giving myself only a little time.Either our partners in government and in the nation give a frank response to the solution, or I will have another say,' he added, clearing himself of any responsibility for the country situation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister stood on the side of the protesters who yesterday began to demonstrate throughout the country.'The Lebanese pain is true and I see it and I support any movement to express it,' Hariri said.The prime minister said there is 'a real anger' that exploded in the street, and that people have given 'more than one opportunity' to politicians to make reforms.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WhatsApp Messenger is a freeware, cross-platform messaging and Voice over IP (VoIP) service owned by Facebook.It allows users to send text messages

lаѕt year, saw thе іntеrnаtіоnаl community pledge mоrе thаn $11 bіllіоn іn ѕоft loans аnd grаntѕ.But thіѕ rеԛuіrеѕ a number оf есоnоmіс reforms tо bе carried out bеfоrе the funds аrе unlocked.The kind
