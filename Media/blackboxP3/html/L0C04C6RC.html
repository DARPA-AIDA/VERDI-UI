weapon intended for use on the rest of the world but, because China doesn't value human life and they find it easier to replace people and machinery than train people properly, the virus escaped from their only maximum-security facility.This explains why the Communist government was so eager to get the infected on planes and send them out to other countries, and why infected in China are trying to spit on and otherwise spread the disease to the uninfected: when you place no value on life except your own, and you're told you're gonna die, why not kill as many others as you
