predicts a wide range of [somethings]; which could be an infection, stress, not enough sleep, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, whatever the cause is, the warning is valid.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of is as a warning light in your car; you can probably keep on driving like normal, but if you do you potentially take the problem from a quick fix all the way to a complete failure/crash/burnout.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we're seeing now is that people wearing heart/health monitors like these makes it possible to turn on these warning lights waaay before they were noticed in the past.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let's extrapolate from this, and guess a future feature that might be possible due to these findings:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Covid-19 apps focuses on tracking outbreaks, alerting those that potentially have been exposed; but imagine if these apps could use the heart rate data to tell people, long before they feel it themselves, that they just in case should stay at home.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're talking about, based on what they say here, potentially a whole week of a spreader being out of the system.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potentially this could in an anonymised format also be reported to the local health authorities; making it possible to predict major outbreaks based on the population's heart rates.They could even prepare/stand down healthcare services by predicting what will/might happen a week into the future; making it much easier to not burnout the healthcare workers.</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These watches, combined with the magic of scientists, could be amazingly revolutionary.</blockquote></p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

usual.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you took my 'usual' to mean some kind of population average and not the 'usual' heart rate of the person being measured.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

change in HRV.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the way there seems to be a misunderstanding among all previous commentators about what HRV is.HRV is expressed in miliseconds and roughly speaking it's the time between successive heart beats (as measured by the Apple Watch ECG).this is not the same as the heart rate in beats per minute where you take averages across several heart beats.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-02-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>mani</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mani said: But is this really specific

that HRV may be predictive of infection, which is what prompted them to do this.They do note several limitations to their study, which is true of all research:</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'First, there was a small number of participants who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in our cohort limiting our ability to determine how predictive HRV can be of infection.However, these preliminary findings support the further evaluation of HRV as a metric to identify and predict COVID-19 and warrant further study.An additional limitation is the sporadic collection of HRV by the Apple Watch.While our statistical modelling was able to account for this a denser dataset would allow for expanded evaluation of the relationship between this metric and infections/symptoms.The Apple Watch also only provides HRV in one time-domain (SDNN), limiting assessment of the relationship between other HRV parameters with COVID-19 outcomes.Lastly, an additional limitation is that we relied on self-reported data in this study, precluding independent verification of COVID-19 diagnosis.'</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it's interesting and supports the need for further work on the value of wearables in detecting and monitoring disease.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-02-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Roller</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News flash Apple Watch

watch CANNOT predict infection a week before the swab detects covid.The watch is not more sensitive than the swab.If those folks had gotten a swab when the heart rate variability changed, they would've likely been positive on the swab.(PCR is super-sensitive.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's just that people who get a swab AND were wearing a watch had increased heartbeat variation</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, it seems like what they mean by '7 days before' is a window including the 7 days before infection, not actually 7 days before the first positive test.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes sense as the time from exposure to symptoms is an average of only 5 days with many people experiencing symptoms 2-3 days after exposure.People I know personally had symptoms 2.5 days after exposure.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-02-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Canezmd</p></p><p><p><img
