Border Patrol, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, National Guard, Coast Guard, Federal Protective Service,' according to a Department of Homeland Security memo leaked to Yahoo News.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New York City Police Department has even requested drones from the Coast Guard.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even U.S. foreign intelligence agencies could be roped into the domestic turmoil.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Jenna McLaughlin, Sean Naylor and I reported at Yahoo News, at a recent 'virtual town hall,' employees of the Defense Intelligence Agency, which is primarily focused on military intelligence, raised concerns over word that a Defense Intelligence Agency task force was created to focus on the unrest.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to sources, the DIA director denied any specific domestically focused task force but acknowledged that the agency was looking at any 'foreign nexus' to the protests.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A DIA spokesperson told Yahoo News that the agency had created 'an internal coordination group to respond to increased and appropriate Department requests for information' regarding the unrest.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line: Revelations of illegal surveillance of protesters and activists during the Vietnam War era created great scandal and upheaval and catalyzed many of todayâ€™s most important laws and prohibitions governing domestic intelligence-gathering.Now the test is whether the U.S. government unlearned that lesson in the decades since.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to watch: On Tuesday, 35 House Democrats sent law enforcement agencies a letter demanding an end to protest surveillance.</li><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Zach Dorfman of the Aspen Institute</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CGD8.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CC7E.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-06-10</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-15</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04CGCV</p></body></html>
