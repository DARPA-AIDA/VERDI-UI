a heat-stable enzyme then copies eac</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about the accuracy of the laboratory tests like when it is used to diagnose the infection with the COVID-19, then there come two terms: sensitivity and specificity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensitivity talks about whether the test is capable of telling when an individual is infected.Specificity talks about when the individual is not infected.A sensitive test is less likely to provide false-negative results, and the test that is highly specific would give false positives.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, mainly whenever there is a test to diagnose COVID-19, it is a molecular test.It merely means that it works with identifying the gen</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any infective agent eg.bacteria or virus , after entry in to the body , initiates the body defence system to produce response.These are usually two types , immediate like increase in platelets and white blood cells for initial fighting and throwing out the infectious agent, jacking up the body temperature so that infectious agent, and producing Very specific antibodies against infection.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence two major criteria for screwing persons with infection are 1) rise in body temperature 2) presence of infectious agent 3) presence of antibody to infection.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To screen the first two methods are used while</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them.The virus has not been purified.(1)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective.(3)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives.We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic.(4 , 5)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)</p><p></p><p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;n/a</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-21</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04AOTJ</p></body></html>
