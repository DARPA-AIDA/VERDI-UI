2019</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, hundreds of thousands of aliens deliberately violate our nation’s laws by unlawfully crossing U.S. borders.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast Facts Illegal migration costs the American taxpayer approximately $132 billion annually, and could exceed $200 billion by 2025.There are at least approximately 14.3 million illegal aliens in the United States as of 2019, a jump of nearly 2 million people since 2017.There are 564 lawless 'sanctuary' jurisdictions throughout the United States as of May 2018.In Fiscal Year 2019, the Border Patrol apprehended a near-record 860,000 illegal aliens nationwide, of which 852,000 (99 percent) were caught while attempting to cross the Southwestern border.Illegal aliens are typically at least three times more likely to be incarcerated than citizens and legal immigrants.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darn those pesky facts.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-14T19:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
