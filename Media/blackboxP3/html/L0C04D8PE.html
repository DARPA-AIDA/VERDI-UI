under the control of government forces.The government forces succeeded in seizing the airport and other areas of the Aden port from separatist forces in southern Yemen, German news agencies reported Wednesday quoting Yemen’s security circles.Yemeni separatists in the southern part of Yemen have surrendered after fierce clashes.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi (born 1 September 1945) is a Yemeni politician and former Field Marshal of the Yemeni Armed Forces.He has been the President of Yemen since 27 February 2012, and was Vice President from 1994 to 2012.</figcaption><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495Y0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to that, army forces occupied the center of Zinjibar province after fierce fighting with the separatists in the south of Yemen.For nearly two weeks, the port of Aden and its surrounding areas have been the scene of violent clashes between President Abdul Mansour Hadi‘s supportive forces and militants calling themselves the Transitional Council of Yemen.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides in the conflict in Aden are both suppose to be fighting the Houthi Shiites backed by the Islamic Republic of Iran, and both enjoy the support of the Saudi-led coalition.After clashes between separatists in the south and forces loyal to the government, Abdar Mansour Hadi and most of his cabinet ministers settled in Riyadh.Yemeni separatists in southern Yemen were then able to seize the presidential palace in the port of Aden and most of the important government buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Transitional Council of Southern Yemen called for the division of Yemen into the southern and northern parts.Prior to the unification of Yemen, the country was divided into north and south.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Split in the Saudi Arabian Coalition</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yemen is a country at the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia.It is the second-largest Arab sovereign state in the peninsula, occupying 527,970 square kilometres (203,850 square miles).The coastline stretches for about 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles).It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf of Aden and Guardafui Channel to the south, and the Arabian Sea and Oman to the east.Yemen’s territory encompasses more than 200 islands, including the largest island in the Middle East, Socotra.Yemen is a member of the Arab League, United Nations, Non-Aligned Movement and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clashes between forces loyal to Abdur Mansur Hadi and separatists in southern Yemen showed a deep rift in the Arab coalition.The UAE, which is a member of the Arab coalition, supports the Transitional Council of the South and Saudi Arabia supports the legal government of Abdul Mansour Hadi.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of this rift and the continuing clashes weakened Riyadh’s position in Yemen against the Iranian-backed Houthis.The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia had a common stance against Iran, especially in a coalition against Iran-backed Houthis.Saudi Arabia and the UAE see Iran as their common enemy, but in the southern part of Yemen, both countries have different interests.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Yemen, the devastating proxy war between pro-Iranian Shiite rebels and Yemeni government forces has been ongoing for years.Government forces are backed by the Saudi-led Arab coalition.The war in Yemen began when the Houthis occupied the northern part of the country, including its capital, Sana’a, and ousted the constitutional government recognized by the United Nations.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations has long sought to persuade all parties involved in the Yemeni crisis to find a peaceful solution to ending the crisis in the region.The Yemeni civil war has starved millions of its citizens, and according to the United Nations, the crisis has become the world’s largest humanitarian disaster.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on
