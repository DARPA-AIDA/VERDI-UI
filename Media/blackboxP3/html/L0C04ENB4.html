but in Pennsylvania, Democratic voters are three times as many as Republican voters.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, Texas also released data, showing that the number of early voters in the state exceeded 9 million, which has exceeded the total number of votes in the state of Texas in the last general election.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, in the 20 states where voters’ party identities were announced, there were approximately 19.9 million registered Democrats in the early voting, 6.9 million more than 13 million registered Republicans.But party status is not necessarily equated with their voting results.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Associated Press stated that it cannot be based on the results of the early voting to draw the Democratic lead.Because polls show that many Republican voters believe Trump’s warning about mailing votes, they plan to wait until November 3 to vote in person.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the early voting fever of the Democratic Party may be slowly caught up by the Republican Party.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miami voters casting their ballots.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Trump continues to lag behind in the polls, the 'Capitol Hill' still pointed out a 'turnover' plan for the US president: Trump must win Florida and Pennsylvania.As long as he can keep Arizona and other states that he won four years ago, even if he loses Michigan and Wisconsin, he can still be re-elected.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the RCP poll website, Biden currently leads Trump by an average of 1.2% in Florida and 3.6% in Pennsylvania.The elections in the two places are still stalemate.And Biden’s popularity among Latinos in Florida has also aroused the concerns of local Democrats.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countdown to polling day in the U.S. general election, President Trump and the Democratic presidential candidate Biden, who are fighting for re-election, stepped up the campaign in the key swing states of Pennsylvania and Michigan in the last weekend before the election.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump held four campaign rallies in Pennsylvania on Saturday.Trump told his supporters that 'the country will realize the American dream.'Trump stated that the United States is only a few weeks away from mass distribution of the new coronavirus vaccine.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-01T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Doris Mkwaya</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y3.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04E5Y8.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04ENBR.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04ENBK.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495XV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495XW.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495YA.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y8.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495YI.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495Y0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y2.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495YE.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495Y7.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-11-01</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-07-09</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04ENB4</p></body></html>
