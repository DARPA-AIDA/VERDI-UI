governance and handling of the pandemic.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His detention is the latest example of the Chinese government’s extensive intolerance of dissent.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese authorities on Monday arrested a 57-year-old law professor who published essays and critical texts on President Xi Jinping.The Tsinghua University law professor, Xu Zhangrun, was critical of Xi’s 'awkward' management of the coronavirus pandemic and his authoritarian efforts to consolidate power.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu Zhangrun is a Chinese jurist.He is a professor of Jurisprudence and Constitutional Law at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and a research fellow with the Unirule Institute of Economics.On 6 July 2020, Xu was detained by Chinese police at his home in Beijing.</figcaption><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495Y0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu, one of the Chinese government’s few public critics, was taken from his home on the outskirts of Beijing by more than 20 people, reported one of his friends, who requested to remain anonymous.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February, the professor published an essay criticizing Xi’s culture of deception and censorship, following the emergence of the coronavirus in China, which got a wide audience both in China and abroad.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law professor at Tsinghua University, one of the very best academic institutions in the country, had already criticized the abolition of presidential term limits in 2018.The text also got a wide circulation on the internet, both at home and abroad.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professor’s friend told the media that a person who claimed to be a police officer called Xu’s wife to inform him that he had been arrested for allegedly soliciting prostitution in the southwestern city of Chengdu.Xu visited Chengdu last winter with several colleagues.Xu’s friend replied that the charges against the professor are 'ridiculous'.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'People nationwide, including the entire bureaucratic elite, feel once more lost in uncertainty about the direction of the country and about their own personal security,' Professor Xu wrote in an essay from 2018.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February, when China’s coronavirus outbreak was at its peak, many Chinese nationals were calling for freedom of expression, especially following the death of a whistle-blower doctor.At the time, Xu, in protest against the nation’s government wrote, 'the angry people are no longer afraid.'</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ren Zhiqiang is a Chinese former real estate tycoon, a member of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, and a blogger on Sina Weibo with more than 37 million followers.He disappeared on 12 March 2020 after criticizing Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping over the handling of China’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essay condemned Xi, and what Xu described as the 'ethically bankrupt' Communist Party.Xi alleged the CPC made their staying in power a priority over protecting Chinese citizens’ lives.'It is a system that turns every natural disaster into an even greater man-made catastrophe,' Xu wrote.'The coronavirus epidemic has revealed the rotten core of Chinese governance.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Xu continued to write, despite warnings from university officials and colleagues.His detention is the latest example of the Chinese government’s extensive intolerance of dissent.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, Beijing imposed a comprehensive national security law to strengthen its control over Hong Kong.Professor Xu’s case raises fears in Hong Kong that intellectual critics of the Communist Party of Cina in the semi-autonomous territory could also be arrested.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After resisting a wave of public outrage in dealing with the Wuhan outbreak, the party arrested freelance bloggers working in Wuhan, and sought revenge against renowned critics, including Beijing-based billionaire Ren Zhiqiang.Ren has been under investigation since April.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ren, a real estate tycoon, and Xu, a leading jurist, adopt different styles of criticizing Xi’s style of governance.However, their message is the same.Both are warning about the stricter restrictions on speech and basic freedoms in China and Xi’s autocratic style of governance.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow

observation and research into natural phenomena in the fields of meteorology, hydrology, seismology and volcanology, among other related scientific fields.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy rains have prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to declare high alerts in Fukuoka, Saga, and Nagasaki areas, which are situated on the southwestern island of Kyushu.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy rains are in addition to those that were witnessed over the weekend in Kumamoto and Kyushu, where the majority of fatalities and

overflows and floods in a dozen towns, in addition to landslides and blockades of roads.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biggest Rains Ever Recorded</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainfall of up to 100 millimeters per hour, with 800 millimeters accumulated, have been recorded in this region.These are levels that have never been observed in the region’s history.In the other three regions put on alert, the level of rainfall is also the highest recorded in decades at this time of year in Japan, considered the rainy season.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteorological department projections have led local

coronavirus infections.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wet season (sometimes called the rainy season) is the time of year when most of a region’s average annual rainfall occurs.The wet season is known by many different local names throughout the world.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JMA anticipates that the torrential rains will continue in the southwest of the country for the rest of the day on Monday and Tuesday, and recommends that the inhabitants of the affected areas should remain in their homes, as long as they are safe or move to the evacuation centers established by the authorities.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan’s annual rainy season is normally characterized by heavy and deadly floods, accompanied by landslides.Japan is a fairly mountainous nation, and most of its rivers are relatively short and steep.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boasting of a population of about 127 million people, it’s population density is very high, and most of its residential and industrial areas are situated in lowland areas, along rivers.These areas are highly vulnerable to floods.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late June through mid-July 2018, continuous heavy rains that were witnessed in the southwestern region of Japan led to widespread, devastating floods and mudflows that claimed the lives of at least 155 people and left behind massive losses and damages.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were just a few websites through which you could earn money with online surveys, but earnings depend
