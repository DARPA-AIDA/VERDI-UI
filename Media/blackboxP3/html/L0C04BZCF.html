Masks Don’t Protect Against Tear Gas, Why Would They Work for COVID-19?</h1><p>If Masks Don’t Protect Against Tear Gas, Why Would They Work for COVID-19?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N95 masks offer a certain amount of protection from others to the wearer--but the real focus of their effectiveness is in protecting others FROM the wearer by containing his breath plume.(Just try blowing out a candle from six inches away while wearing one.)The incidence of transmission drops dramatically if everyone wears a mask, keeps a certain distance, and limits time in poorly ventilated areas--but it only takes one bonehead strutting maskless down a supermarket aisle, showing off his sneering contempt for the sheeple, to undercut a whole building full of good intentions.If you want to draw a parallel with CS gas, you might consider how effective the stuff would be if you had to wrap the canister in a towel and put it in a cloth bag before deploying it.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

suggested ordinary masks do not achieve a 50% threshold of protection from</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outside infection</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the wearer.The study did not deal with the question of whether masks protected others from the wearer, which has for some time been the primary rationale for their use.This very limited finding was cherry-picked by opportunistic right-wing 'research' trolls, who simplified it for their base as 'masks don't work.'This translation was then fed into the amazingly efficient right-wing media machine--the same one that had every conservative in the US calling Covid-19 'the Chinese virus' in lockstep uniformity 12 hours after Mr. Trump first used the term.From there it was eagerly snatched up as 'proof' by people eager to rationalize their own refusal to participate in basic public health measures--so dead certain of their own tin-foil-hat conspiracy beliefs that they're willing to bet other people's lives on them.Never mind the fact--as Doofus has quite rightly pointed out in this thread--that the very people who published the study rushed to protest this gross misrepresentation of their findings, and to affirm that masks are an effective preventative measure if properly deployed.By that, they mean 'worn by everyone involved,' not 'just worn by the sheeple while courageous patriots bravely bare their mugs.'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Battling Bob</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes your silly cloth and surgical masks with gaps between the mask and the wearers face big enough for a humming bird to fly through are going to stop exhalation of a virus so small 68,000,000 particles or more of it will fit in a single square mm.Yeah sure.More magical thinking.Sweden really put the lie to this silliness.No mask mandates and currently 22% lower per capita death rate than the US</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

issued a statement weeks ago that they did nothing of the sort, their conclusions were being taken completely out of context and that masks are quite effective in preventing viral spread from an infected person outward to others.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because the virus can enter through the eyes and through side gaps, they're slightly less effective at preventing uninfected people from contracting the virus if it's in the air around the mask wearer.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And people have been repeating this entire year that 'masks are intended to protect people around you because you can be asymptomatic and contagious, not to protect you specifically'.Duh.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

KN95 that dont meet specs a and are being seized by the millions by ICE.2.SARS-CoV-2 is not CS.It replicates.CS doesn't.One molecule can become a billion and as such protection needs to be 100%.If anything gets through you are getting infected.3.There is no reason to believe material that fails to filter viral molecules in 1 direction will filter them in the other.Even if respiratory droplets are stopped viral particles will simply be forced through the porous material or out the gaping gaps between most of these cloth and surgical masks and the wearers face by the force of exhalation.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-26T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>stevesomebody</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'but it only takes one bonehead

indicated that the risk of transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals is relatively low.Perhaps this is because they're not dribbling snot or coughing up wads of mucus as they do their shopping.But your guide apparently checked out for lunch before he got you to the part about presymptomatic transmission, and the notion that 'peak transmissibility of COVID may be at or just prior to symptom onset': 'The lack of substantial transmission from observed asymptomatic index cases is notable.However, presymptomatic transmission does occur, with some studies reporting the timing of peak infectiousness at approximately the period of symptom onset.'You may note that as far as our bonehead is concerned, there is no observable difference between someone who's just about to start hacking his lungs up on the way home from the store, and someone who's not.The whole point is that we don't know whether he's spreading the virus, and neither does he.I suspect that at least SOME of the 350,000 dead Americans were actually surprised to discover they had Covid-19, and might wish that they and their local boneheads had been wearing masks.As far as a 'Chinese bioweapon' is concerned, I'm afraid your beloved science keeps betraying you by finding that this virus has none of the hallmarks of an engineered bug.But the mere fact that you use the expression--which makes about as much sense as calling the 1918 influenza epidemic a 'Kansas bioweapon'--suggests that you're incapable of persuasion on that score.Instead we might talk about what we would do if it inarguably WAS a weapon--as if we discovered that over decades, the Chinese had secretly deposited stores of weapons-grade plutonium all over our country as contaminated dust, and were just now activating the mechanical spreaders to pour the stuff into the air.Would we ignore the dust, and go on about our business?Or would we launch a robust national program to minimize the damage it caused?I'd be rooting for the latter approach mystelf.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Battling Bob</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you are worried about it wear your silly piece of cloth with pore sizes 100 times larger than the virus you think it's going to filter.If it actually works you have nothing to worry about from anybody else.Sorry to break it to you but actually effective PPE protects you regardless of what the person next to you is wearing.If you are worried about what they're wearing or not wearing you must not have much faith in what you're wearing</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-26T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>stevesomebody</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's incredibly simple to see the proof of whether masks work.Look at the infection rates in states that did not have a mask mandate and then observe how the rates dropped when they were finally required.Every.Single.Time.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Doofus</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except that your claim

covid-19) unleashed unto the world will be with us forever.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We haven't been able to eradicate the flu and this will be no different.It will continue to mutate, and vaccines will have limited effectiveness.The good news is, the survival rate is over 99%.That's a lot better odds than many other illnesses that kill many more Americans every year.If this is about saving lives, maybe we should focus on those illnesses that take the most lives first?(and can be prevented)</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

data show that mask mandates in the U.S. and other countries did not prevent a surge of cases.During the U.S. surge in the fall, 97 of the 100 counties with the most confirmed cases had either a county-level mask mandate, a state-level mandate, or both.search: heritage mask mandate</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Scott Hamilton</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obama Best President made no claim for mask mandates.He said, 'Masks slow the spread of viruses.'You agreed, then took a sudden left turn, without signaling, to mask mandates.Of course, mask mandates only work well if people obey them, just as 'Slow: School Zone' signs only save children's lives if people refrain from goosing Ol' Betsy past the elementary building during recess.If they don't so refrain, we'll find people on social media arguing that 'Slow: School Zone' signs don't work.Interestingly, the Heritage Foundation study you link pretty much does the same thing--disclaims any notion that they're trying to undercut the effectiveness of mask use, then swerves sideways into the issue of mask mandates, as if mandating masks somehow affected their usefulness.My local observation of mandate effectiveness--I live in remote eastern Oregon--suggests that mandates would work a damned sight better if all businesses agreed to enforce them rather than just posting signs on the door.I suspect our boneheads would adjust fairly rapidly if all businesses simply refused to serve them--the uproars that would occur in the short term could be dealt with as disturbances of the peace in that case rather than 'policing mask use.'The Heritage writers also cite the Danish study 'Thomas' referred to, above--but like Thomas, ignore the fact that the study used an all-or-nothing 50% benchmark, well above the hazy 35% I've seen offered as the best-case scenario for personal protection.Any assessment of the effectiveness of mask mandates, whether in US counties or foreign countries, needs to control first for other variables; second for whether the mandate arises before the surge or in response to a surge, also allowing for a maximum incubation period; and third for the extent to which the mandates are obeyed.Per my earlier scenario, transposed to the supermarket aisle--how many people could a single person covered with fine plutonium dust contaminate simply by strolling the aisles of a crowded supermarket, handling the goods, paying no attention to the directional arrows, and brushing by people without any concern for proximity?I have no beef with the Heritage study's call for much more robust 'other' responses to the pandemic, but weirdly, I imagine the people raising hell about masks today will raise hell about those responses as well.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Battling Bob</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweden had

believe that 'masks' of the cloth and surgical variety that most people are using will stop viral particles.The pores in the material are a 100 or more times larger than the viral particles they seek to filter.Droplets will simply soak into the material and the viral particles will pass right through.Same for already aerosolized particles.No BSL3 lab anywhere in the world relies on such 'protection' from this or any other virus.These masks might stop a modest percentage of particles but that means nothing with biological agents which replicate after exposure.It only takes one molecule to pass through and become millions or billions.N95 or N100 respirators might offer very minimal protection from very limited exposure but again no BSL3 lab where SARS-CoV-2 is handled uses these in a hot area, against it or anything else so what does that tell you?For perspective none of these devices are even suitable for asbestos protection and asbestos particles are much larger and do not replicate and they are still completely unsuitable and not acceptable for asbestos exposed personnel.Against a virus these things are just a feel good measure.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
