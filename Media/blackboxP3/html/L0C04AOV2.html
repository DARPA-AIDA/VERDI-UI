useful info.'But we have learned much about this virus in 7 months and SARS-CoV-2, like other viruses we detect with RT-rPCR, is present before and during the peak symptomatic period.These are also the times we get sampled and tested because we feel sick.We know from experience that when detectable viral RNA is present in a patient’s sample, there is often an infectious virus present as well.RNA is not so stable that it hangs around without a constant source producing more of it.'This is a crucial area surrounding the current ‘casedemic’ in Europe.Virtually all positive PCR tests are of asymptomatic people and the data shows they are mostly young people.For how long does the viral RNA remain detectable after the infection has passed?I have read studies where infectious and

least +50%).In addition to that we have asymptomatic test streets throughout the country… (and as I understand it this is per WHO recommendation so will be true for most countries?).In light of that there seems enough room for reasonable doubt about the value of the current PCR test methodology?Read: can you prove beyond a doubt that the current (imho very high ) randomness is not (negatively) impacting the overall result: read at current it looks the virus is only at max 10%(looking at the more apparent results such as hospital/icu admissons and deaths against higher positive tests) of what it was in march/april(when your statement was more true).I know it’s more complex but enough to be open for debate and interpretation but that’s not what is happening(at least not in

coronaviruses (with the exception of SARS-CoV-1 or a similar related virus).Do you have a view why children seem to be immune to this disease?Would you agree with Prof Beda Stadler (Sweden) view that kids has been exposed to so many forms of coronaviruses, that they have developed partial immunity to some of the surface proteins that may be common to both past coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2?Thanks,

shed the virus and are involved in transmission to adults.The risk of illness increases with the child’s age; it is extraordinarily low at the young end of the spectrum.Transmission from young children is rare.This may be related to recent past exposures to one or more of the human CoVs (229E, OC43, NL64 or HKU1) but we’ll need some evidence before we all run off and believe it to be so.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-10-14T13:55:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Ian M Mackay</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m worried by this article.'We’re

Viruses, but the most of them are unknown.So the primer is only specific against known Viruses.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that’s not the main problem.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.) infected or ill?The PCR Test only detect the possibilty presence of a Virus.But there are always and everday a lot of Viruses present in our body.Our immune defence is always fighting against them.And that’s the point here.Since the most people are not ill and many show no sympthoms, it seems that the virus try to infected the first cells, but never had a chance to spawn.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of studies which see a possible big T-Cell answer ( e.g. https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-35331/v1%20 ) and in this case the PCR Test is also positive, but it’s doubful if there is a real infection (it depends wich definition you count.)neither a transmission, because the virus is not augmentable anymore.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also this T-Cell response may responsible for the big difference between the dead cases in the regions.For example compare, Peru and Singapore – the later had a big Sars outbreak in the past and a possible cross immunity https://biospectrumasia.com/news/26/16310/singapore-scientists-uncover-sars-cov-2-specific-t-cell-immunity.html</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the question still remains, did the PCR Test really test an infection?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-09-12T19:39:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>mutant77</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.) The primers are indeed specific to what they are intended to detect.That’s how they’re designed.In this case, SARS-CoV-2.b.)The PCR test detected an infection.Yes.The virus may be at such low levels once finally tested that the [person is not a transmission risk *now* – but they were at some point.So then you can track their close contacts and ask them to quarantine for up to 2 weeks to make sure they don’t become ill and carry on the spread.If testing takes too long, this won’t be useful of course.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-09-13T13:57:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

say it is enough specific.But you only know 10% maybe 15% or even much less viruses DNA/RNA.So the claimed specific is only specific for known viruses.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B) that’s the question.What you say is what you guess.Is there any study which looks if there was any Transmission from a 'asymtompic' PCR positive?For my understanding of the immun reaction it shouldn’t.You say they track the contacts so there should be a Lot knownledge of this.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-09-29T15:40:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

public health and treating doctors is essential to understand any positive result.Countries where this works well, and where contact tracing is even possible, have shown this to be the case.For example New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, China, Japan, South Korea and more</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-10-10T09:15:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Ian M

quite likely share the same sequence which it’s tested for.You can’t say it’s testing for SARS-cov2 specifically if you don’t even know what all coronaviruses (or others) have the same exact sequence.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-10-07T10:40:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>DM</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true.But so far, of those that have been fully sequenced – and there have been a record number of viral genomes analysed – they’ve</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been SARS-CoV-2 and not a different virus.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-10-10T09:13:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Ian M Mackay</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the test isn’t if it can detect the virus, it is whether the virus they’re detecting is at an infectious level.The virus is almost always NOT infectious above 30 cycles of the test, yet 37-40 cycles is being used to detect positive cases.That leads us to believe at least 63% of positive tests shouldn’t be.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-09-12T21:25:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Ron</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be clear, the virus detected below 30 cycles isn’t always able to be cultured using cell culture nor is that detected above 30 cycles never able to be cultured.Reasons may include the specimen being from the wrong anatomical area, specimen sat around too long, it wasn’t kept at the right temperature, it wasn’t protected by the addition of buffered with culture medium, the people trying to grow virus are not suitable expert, it was frozen and thawed a few times first, and so on.Culture failing to 'grow' virus doesn’t mean there is not infectious virus there – its a bit more complex than that.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-09-13T13:54:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Ian M Mackay</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, they want as many positive cases as possible, so keeping the cycles high is the way to go.There is the argument though that with only 33 cycles it would quite likely miss detecting the virus, so more false negatives.What’s so useless about these tests is the answer is either positive or negative, rather than giving any numbers as estimates how many viruses there are, cos that would tell more of the infection and whether the person is significantly gonna spread it.At the moment the test is pretty useless.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

in an hour or less.Additionally, it’s important for the patients who have been tested to be notified of the results as soon as possible.Even if a telegram is necessary, they need to know so they can take immediate action and contain the spread of the virus as much as possible.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-09-26T02:49:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Rebecca

Corona-critics / Corona-deniers here in Holland.(Not that the die-hards can be convinced with clear, scientific facts, alas).I have a technical question, hope you can help me out: The PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands originally focused on two targets: the E gene and the RdRP gene (Corman 2020).With the experience gained with this, most laboratories have chosen to test only for the most sensitive E gene, also because of the scarcity of materials.In the meantime, the RdRP gene PCR SARS-CoV-2 has been made specific and comparable to the sensitivity of the E gene PCR by various laboratories.Now, I don´t work with the PCR-test so this doesn´t mean much to me.The key question is: does testing only for the most sensitive E gene, make the PCR-test more or less reliable in detecting SARS-Cov-2?Or doesn´t it make any difference because the E-gene is specific to SARS-Cov-2?Any influence on the Ct cycles needed to get a positive or negative result?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-10-18T22:57:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Dieles Stolk</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend the use of a second target, however, as you note, there have been worldwide shortages of reagents to fuel the PCR machine, as well as huge demand for testing, so compromises have to be made to find as many cases as possible and prevent spread.Using one reliable and sensitive test is a good way to go.Using Corman’s E doesn’t make it more or less reliable; just reliable.The E also detects some closely related bat cronaviruses – but they don’t exist in humans so not an issue.Ct cycles should be considered along with the patient’s status – all part of the collaboration between lab and patient’s doctor and public health expertise.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-10-27T08:48:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Ian M Mackay</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the big question, When

by limiting dilution studies using characterized samples.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analytical sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assays contained in the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019- nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel were determined in Limit of Detection studies.Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.Samples were extracted using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument and EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (Cat# 62724) and manually with the QIAGEN DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat# 61904).Real-Time RT-PCR assays were performed using the ThemoFisher Scientific TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Cat# A15299) on the Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument according to the CDC 2019-nCoV RealTime RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel instructions for use.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Page 39

bailen</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings and thank you for your time and effort to answer all those questions!I would like to know what information the immune system needs in order to create antibodies for a certain virus?Does it get it from the proteins of the membrane, or the RNA of the virus.Is it possible for the immune system to start creating antibodies, just from fragments of a virus (not a whole 'functioning' one) that somehow have gotten into our body?Thank you!</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-13T08:07:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

response.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-22T19:59:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Ian M Mackay</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your thoughts here.We understand that the higher the cycles set on the PCR test, the more positive results we will get.For example if the cycles are at 60, it will almost always provide a positive result even on a healthy person.It would be fair to run the cycles at 20 for more accurate results.Why is it that the cycles are not standardized at the Testing centers?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

specific to detect and amplify specific DNA.You are not going to get a positive result no matter how many cycles you set the machine up if there isn’t base material present there in the first place.I’m surprised he had the patience to last this long.The amount of disinformation you guys are willfully absorbing and spewing out, amplified like a virus, is alarming and a sickness in and of itself.You haven’t disproven or cured cancer or ED, have you?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-02-22T01:08:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Random</p></p><p><p><img
