and it was she who, by her own, brought the virus to China.This statement is not only true to most of the 1.4 billion people, but also relevantThe video doesn't go viral around the world every day, and even three speakers have spoken out on the U.S. social platform Twitter, repeatedly publicly caring about the health and current situation of the 'female U.S. soldier'!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pressures, from civil and official sources around the world, have completely upended the otherwise peaceful and normal work and life of the Margers...</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie Benasi's husband, named Matt Benassi, said in a CNN television interview with tears of grief that their home address had also been posted online and that their social media platforms and emails had been filled with threats and cursing messages from conspiracy theorists from around the world before they had to close their social media accounts.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, we.It's like waking up from a nightmare and going into another nightmare.'The Benassis acceptedCNNThe interview said it was her first public statement since becoming a victim of online rumors.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie and her husband, Matt, are still working in government.Major is a civilian employee of the U.S. Army in Fort Belvo one, Virginia, where she serves as a security officer.Matt is a retired Air Force officer who is now a civilian employee of the Air Force department within the Pentagon.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt said his family had gone through a rather desperate and difficult time when he was first diagnosed with cancer.But this time the 'zero zero' hit all of their families more than he had been diagnosed with cancer!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to an exclusive television interview with CNN, Trump's personal enemy, the facts and the truth are:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Italian rapper 'Benny Benassi', with the United States Maggie Benassi and her husband Matt Benassi has never met, not to be related, just one of thousands of namesakes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Major-Benassi and her husband, Matt Benasi, have never tested positive for coronavirus, and neither has any symptoms associated with the children!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.This Benassi couple in the United States, and far away in the sky, 'Italian rapper' Benassi, never met, did not know, of course, and have no relatives!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.'Benassi' is a very common and common surname in Italian and Italian, just like Chinese's Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhao, Wu!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these, does not affect the majority of the people unanimously identified as the world's 'zero zero'!The so-called 'false true and false', now, true and false when no one recognized - as long as someone questioned the story of this 'American women soldiers', then you must be in the eyes of the world 'beautiful dog', at least a 'sweat shoulder'!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During China's anti-epidemic period, a series of heroic stories were produced, as well as a series of new era 'words'.'A grain of dust of the times, falling on a person's head, is a mountain', is one of the many new words that emerged in the war against the epidemic.This sentence, used in the 'female soldiers of the United States army', could not be more appropriate:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I hope people don't harass me anymore, because it's cyberbullying for me and it's out of control.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie and her cancer-prone husband, Matt, wept in an exclusive CNN television interview.The family has repeatedly tried to get technology companies to broadcast these fake videos and rumors liveRemove and prevent it from spreading online.They contacted a lawyer, but the lawyer told them that there was really no better way than to prosecute the rumor-mongers.However, in the United States, the costs and costs of prosecuting these disinformationors are by no means affordable for this ordinary working-class American couple...!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most prominent supporter of this conspiracy theory is the American George W. Bush-Weber, he59years old, a prolifying rumor-seller.In his imagintic world, Benassi plays the lead role in conspiracy theories.Over the years, Weber has been regularly inYouTubeall kinds of long-running defamation live broadcasts, and alreadyYouTubeaccumulated more than2700million views and near10Millions of fans.Some rumors have also led to direct economic losses.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example:2017CNN has revealed how Webb worked in a group of conspiracy theorists who pushed a ship on a ship 'Dirty bomb '(Note: So-called dirty bombs and dirty nuclear bombs are a combination of conventional explosives and radioactive materials.)One15kilograms of plutonium bomb, if dropped from the plane, in1000Detonation at an altitude of meters can cause

closure of parts of one of the nation's largest ports for some time on security grounds.Weber said that until recently, hisYouTubeThere are ads in the video——That means Google's platform is profiting from Weber's mis-information, as Weber himself makes money.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately:Conspiracy theories are no different from viruses, evolve, and adapt themselves to new environments in order to spread themselves further and survive better.Variant versions had been circulating online for months before Benassi became the star of the conspiracy theory.In the early weeks of the coronavirus, conspiracy theorists began to claim, without evidence, that it was a biological weapon of the United States.Until.3In June, months after the first case of coronavirus was reported, conspiracy theorists turned their attention to Maggie-Benassi.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This purely conjecture but unfounded theory began with her10He traveled to China last month to take part in the World Military Games, known as the 'Olympic Games' between the world's military, organized by Wuhan.Maggie-Benassi competed in a 'cycling race' but suffered an accident on the final lap, which resulted in a broken rib and concussion.Despite the accident, Benasi insisted on completing the race.Unfortunately, accidents and injuries are just the beginning of a series of more unfortunate disasters...!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the story of the 'Female Soldiers of the U.S. Army' appeared, a video appeared online.The video is described as 'an American doctor assembling a team of experts to conduct their own research and hold seminars in their own homes to thoroughly expose the source of the new crown and patient number zero!'!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've seen this video!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, from the Chinese people's strong comrade-in-arms CNN exclusive interview to understand: that the American, at home in front of the camera and face-to-face talk about this 'patient zero' conspiracy theorists, the original is not only a rumor supporter, but also a prolific rumor tout!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what 1.4 billion people don't necessarily know is:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, Weber has been regularly inYouTubeon all kinds of long-running rumor class live, and already inYouTubeaccumulated more than2700million views and near10Millions of fans.Some rumors have also caused significant economic losses directly to the country and its people.For example:2017CNN has revealed how Webb worked in a group of conspiracy theorists who pushed a rumor:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there's one15kilograms of plutonium bombs, dropped from the plane, in1000Detonation at an altitude of meters can cause diameter2000the area of rice is contaminated with radioactivity.A cargo ship carrying such a 'dirty bomb' is heading for the United States and is about to arrive at the port of Charleston, South

recently, hisYouTubeThere are ads in the video——That means Google's platform is profiting from Weber's mis-information, as Weber himself makes money.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the allegations about Benassi may be crazy and untrue, the disaster they bring to the victims and the threats and fears they have to face are true: Maggie and Matt cry in a television interview: vicious curses and death threats, accompanied by their fearful lives every day!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, 'It's really hard to hold Webb accountable.'Matt.-Benassi said.'Law enforcement will tell you that there's nothing we can do about it, because in this country we have free speech.And then they said, go talk to a civil lawyer, and we'll do it.We went to find a lawyer.You'll soon realize that litigation is too expensive for ordinary people like us.We don't have law enforcement rec pursue, and we don't have any rec pursue in court.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the story of the 'Female Soldiers of the U.S. Army' was endorsed by the 'American team of medical experts themselves' and returned to China through the characteristic channels of 'export-to-domestic sales', it became 'evidence-based'It's hard to read!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a non-profit organization that studies fake newsFirstDraftChen Rinan, a researcher, said that in China, the attack on
