additionally, some of the variance in percent this study is literally so small it could be construed as statistically insignificant without reporting important factors like diet, exercise and lifestyle.O type blood doesn't necessarily have some magical property A positive doesn't in terms of immunity (as opposed to being useful universal transfusion properties).If this were all TRUE -- we'd see fewer cases of African American COVID because they have a very high prevalance of O compared to Europeans.But we're just not seeing all that in the ICU and in the statistics.A very high amount of African Americans are suffering from Covid-19 due to general effects of diet, lifestyle and living conditions.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

symptoms that doctors are mostly not listening to and dismissing.Many have been diagnosed with cfs/me, myocarditis, sarcoidosis, increased hypertension, heart aneurysm, autoimmune disease, vasculitis, and microembolisms!This is far more than a virus.This is causing people potential life threatening and lifelong issues triggered by the virus.There are at least 30 tests people have listed being sent to.95% of these people had no issues prior to covid.We are seeking media attention so that we gain the attention of studies, doctors, the cdc etc.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

have 1 other problem with what is considered healthy.If your on any medication you are not healthy, if you are over weight you are not healthy etc</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

for sure.I'm O blood type.Back in late February, a friend of mine had a 'strange viral bronchitis' they were sick with (taking into account some experts believe COVID was stateside earlier than March).The 'bronchitis' wiped them out for a good long while.I was around them a few times and never got sick.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast-forward to March when COVID reached my community and a co-worker began falling ill on our shift.Coughing everywhere, etc.I wasn't able to social distance and masks were not a definite recommendation yet.They had a fever and flu-like symptoms but tested negative for flu, and couldn't get a COVID test.Was sure I would be sick next after exposure and close contact with them.But still, I was fine.I get the common cold pretty easily, but have only had the flu once in my life, having never opted for a flu shot.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

antibody that Type A people produce and the Anti-A that Type B people produce are both IgM antibodies.Furthermore the antibody titer in Type O people varies, so such correlations should be investigated.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Ned Boudreaux</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sure what you mean here.Here's what I found,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antibody Test for IgG This test detects IgG antibodies that develop in most patients within seven to 10 days after symptoms of COVID-19 begin.IgG antibodies remain in the blood after an infection has passed.These antibodies indicate that you may have had COVID-19 in the recent past and have developed antibodies that may protect you from future infection.It is unknown at this point how much protection antibodies might provide against reinfection.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antibody Test for IgM This test detects IgM antibodies.IgM is usually the first antibody produced by the immune system when a virus attacks.A positive IgM test indicates that you may have been infected and that your immune system has started responding to the virus.When IgM is detected you may still be infected, or you may have recently recovered from a COVID-19 infection.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this definition IgG and IgM have nothing to do with blood type.They are the antibody for the initial viral response (iGm) and the continuing post viral infection antibody (IgG).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got this from: https://www.nationaljewish....</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Mike</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(my background: I used to write immunohematology software for scheduling whole blood Anti-D injections and prevent complications in pregnant rH- mothers with rH+ partners, so I have studied this field; that said, I'm not an immunologist)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he wrote was exactly correct as he wrote it, though what he wrote isn't specifically relevant to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies so far as I'm aware.Anti-A and Anti-B would be antibodies produced in the case of someone who was not type A or type B most commonly having received a blood transfusion of those types, e.g., if you were another blood type and they had to give you a lifesaving transfusion.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems with SARS-CoV-2 that's been showing up in papers of hospital studies: IgM isn't showing up in the quite ill, sometimes until days after IgG.This isâ€¦very weird.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Deirdre Saoirse

substantial enough to give people either false hope or alarm honestly..7% difference is practically within a margin of error.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>esolesek</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more than .7% You are looking at O type at 3.2% and A type 3.9 % and 3.9 -3.2 =,7.But you forgot about the % of these types in the population.44 % of the population have type O and 42 % have type A.You have to calculate, .032 X 44 = 1.4% and .039 X 42 = 1.64%</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then compare 1.64 to 1.4, The denominator will be 1.64 + 1.4 = 3.04</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type O compare to type A.1.4/3.04 = 46% for type O and for type A it is</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.64/3.04 = 54% So the conclusion is if you have type O then you are 8% less likely to test positive compared to type A.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the other blood types it is even worse because they represent a much smaller % of the population but they tested a higher %.You can do the same calculation with B is only 10% of the population and AB is 4% so they are much higher rate of covid.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Russian,Italian,German</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no

(plural myriads) and Thoreau (a myriad of), and it continues to occur frequently in reputable English.There is no reason to avoid it.'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
