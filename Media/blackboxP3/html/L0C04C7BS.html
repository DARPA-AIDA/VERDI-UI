theories work.There's the merest kernel of truth, which can be researched and proven.And then some nonsense is overlapped on top of it that can't.But if one piece is shown to be true, the theory goes that the whole thing must be true.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case: Truth - 'some test kits ... contaminated with Covid-19'.(In detail, a supplier has warned that some components of some test kits may have been contaminated and would require full cleaning, which would probably result in a delay).</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonsense - 'the British Government have pulled out of a deal with Huawai'.(Not true.But, cannot be researched, since the claim is that Boris Johnson made the decision and he's not in a position to be interviewed).</i></p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

those blokes are doing is essential as fibre is how the fucking blue light services, hospitals, government and anyone else communicates securely and at speed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's also how we are all surviving and not going insane by streaming, downloading, skyping and anything else that needs a speed of more than 10meg</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think this dickwad could talk me through resistance and hertz frequencies that are safe, unsafe, normal, volatile?Of fucking course she couldn't, she's decided instead to bother a couple of lads trying to put food on the table by saying 5G kills people.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bet she buys all her shit online, from ocado or any other online merchant, who would have no hope of running their operation without fibre

that the virus is fake, and covering up the effects of 5G, but also the virus is real, but is linked to 5G, which is being installed to enslave us and control our minds, but also to kill us and it's
