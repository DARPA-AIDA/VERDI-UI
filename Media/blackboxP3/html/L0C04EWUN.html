town of Vila de Rei.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five regions of central and southern Portugal were on high alert due to the risk of fire.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong wind gusts and high temperatures complicated the task of more than 1,700 firemen with the support of airplanes and helicopters in the Castelo Branco region.A suspect believed to have caused the fire has been arrested.The wind and heat complicated the fight against a vast fire in the center of Portugal.So far twenty have been injured, eight firefighters and twelve civilians.One of the civilians, with severe burns, was evacuated by helicopter to Lisbon, 200 kilometers to the south.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portugal is a country located mostly on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe.It is the westernmost sovereign state of mainland Europe, being bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain.Its territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, both autonomous regions with their own regional governments.</figcaption><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495YE.jpg' style='max-width:

firefighters to the task.Firefighters were supported by 480 vehicles and 23 aircraft.The majority of the troops were deployed near the town of Vila de Rei.That town and others near Macao city, with 7,000 inhabitants, suffered terrible consequences of the fire, forcing its inhabitants to wet their houses with buckets of water, hoping to escape the flames unscathed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Only Vila de Rei fire is still active, after progressing 25 kilometers from its point of origin,' declared Portuguese Interior Minister, Eduardo Cabrita, at a press conference.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other fires were checked on Saturday night.A suspect responsible for the fires, a 55-year-old man, was arrested in Castelo Branco, judicial police said.The Army also mobilized, sending 20 soldiers and heavy machinery to open roads and facilitate access to firefighters.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five regions of central and southern Portugal were on high alert due to the risk of fire.These regions of central Portugal are sparsely populated.Its inhabitants, with few resources, tend to plant eucalyptus, a kind of tree that grows rapidly and is appreciated by paper manufacturers.But this reforestation is often done without control, in areas with leafy valleys, where the understory is not adequately cleaned.Eucalyptus is also a highly flammable tree.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of four initial deadly wildfires erupted across central Portugal in the afternoon of 17 June 2017 within minutes of each other, resulting in at least 66 deaths and 204 injured people.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portugal president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, expressed his 'solidarity with the hundreds of people who fight against the scourge of fires,' in a message published online.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first major forest fire of the year in the European country, which in recent times suffered some of the worst fires in its history.Portugal lives under the memory of the terrible fires of June and October of 2017 in the center of the country, which caused the death of 114 people in total.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death toll of that year led the Portuguese government to support more stringent prevention measures and therefore in 2018, there were no deaths from forest fires.According to a study of the European information system on forest fires published in May, more than 250,000 hectares of forest were destroyed by fires across Europe between January and April 2019.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2019-07-22T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>George Mtimba</p></p><p><p><img
