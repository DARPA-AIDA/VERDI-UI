he typically orders batches of 500,000.This time he put in an order for 1 million.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the coronavirus crisis has dragged on, scattered reports have emerged of the federal government seizing PPE shipments.State leaders in Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Kentucky, Texas, and Florida have accused FEMA and the federal government of diverting their orders for protective gear.Colorado governor Jared Polis famously said his order of ventilators was 'swept up' by the agency.Per the</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New York Times,</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the head of the board for the Kentucky Hospital Association wrote that four shipments of protective equipment intended for hospitals were taken by FEMA.In a statement to the</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last month, FEMA asserted it was not seizing any shipments and that 'prioritizing PPE deliveries to COVID hot spots can have the unintended consequence of disrupting the regular supply-chain deliveries to other areas of the country that are also preparing for the coronavirus.'The small business owner’s story, however, goes a step further; it suggests that the federal government has taken control of every level of a private business.(FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the visit from the FBI, the businessman contacted a high-level state official with whom he had a preexisting friendship.The state official offered some advice.'Number one, give them everything they ask for,' the official said, according to the businessman.'Number two, completely cooperate.And number three, from this point forward they are listening to every one of your conversations.They are going to start tapping your phone.'(The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three shipments, carrying a total of 500,000 N95 respirators—the first half of the order—arrived on three separate dates: April 6, April 16, and April 21.All three were seized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to the businessman.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanity Fair</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obtained a document detailing the seizure of one of the shipments dated April 10.In it the businessman is ordered to turn over his materials for federal use; the order cites Donald Trump’s Executive Order 13909, which was issued on March 18, and which lets the government 'determine...the proper nationwide priorities and allocation of all health and medical resources...for responding to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Customs and Border Protection put a hold on the PPE shipment, saying it wanted to conduct a quality control inspection.The shipment was transferred to the Food and Drug Administration, which carried out the inspection and placed its own hold on April 21.'The product is still on hold to this day,' the businessman said.'One of the press secretaries from the governor’s office called me on April 25 and said, ‘I found out why they’re not releasing it.They’re trying to [find] a reason to fail it so that they can keep it.’</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I’m on a phone call with [FEMA].I said, ‘Guys, I just heard I may have failed the [quality control] test,’' the businessman recalled.'And you know what FEMA said?‘That’s okay, we want the product anyway.’'(The businessman told me he has since launched an internal investigation to determine whether his shipment did indeed fail the test.The investigation is ongoing.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I thought to myself, You rat bastards.'FEMA, he said, is like a 'bully at the lunchroom.If his mom’s not going to make him a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, he just goes to the kid that has a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich and takes it from him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They are not trying to puppet-master me,' he said.'They’re trying to squash me...What am I supposed to do?Close my doors because FEMA said they are going to take everything I have?How the hell do they think I feel when nursing homes call me needing earloop masks?How do you feel as a human being?I have a huge warehouse with product that can protect people, and I can’t comprehend how I can’t give it to people.People are dying of thirst, and I’m here with a cooler full of water watching people die.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video</p><p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMBED URL</h4><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIDEO URL</h4><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bad!It looks like we're experiencing playback issues.</h4><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This live video has ended.It will be available to watch shortly.</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See what else is new</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caption Options</h3></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medium</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auto</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottom</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Top</li></p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-06T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Diana Falzone</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C049OJL.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-05-06</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-08</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C049OJI</p></body></html>
