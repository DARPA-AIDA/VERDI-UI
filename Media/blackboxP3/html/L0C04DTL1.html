parameters</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a smart move to buy a new insurance policy after your current policy expires?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all have different lifestyles, and we tend to do things that are suitable for us.The life insurance policy also depends on our need and lifestyle; thus, it varies from person to person.And similarly, term life insurance policy also differs for every person; hence, we cannot generalise and say that buying a new term policy after you outlive your previous insurance policy is a good idea or a bad idea.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be a brilliant decision for those who are young and healthy because they can get a term plan with affordable premiums.Wherein if you are already in old age and have various medical issues, then buying a term plan could be a bit challenging.Moreover, the premium amount can vanish your savings as well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a huge difference in your liabilities and obligations at the time of buying your policy like your home loan, car loan, the number of dependents, etc.However, with the time you may have finished most of your debts and your children also might not be dependent on you anymore.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a case, buying a new term insurance policy in case you outlive your previous life insurance policy could be a smart move.But if you have already finished your debts and you are no longer a single breadwinner of the family, then there’s no need of buying it instead you can opt for other feasible plans available especially for senior citizens.So, the purchase decision depends on your financial requirements and dependents.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is better?– to buy a new policy or to extend current policy using riders?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peculiarly, you cannot outstretch your term insurance policy.Still, there are various riders available, which gives you this option to extend or to convert your policy into a permanent policy.A permanent policy is like an umbrella term that does not expire.However, the premium amount will increase with the conversion of a term insurance policy to a permanent insurance policy, but it also comes with great death benefits.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent policy is like an umbrella term that does not expire.However, the premium amount will
