or for Moksha but to work toward a cause which is to make the world a dwelling place for God.Therefore the Bible teaches, In six days you should do all your work, and in the seventh day should be a day of rest.The majority of life is devoted to work.Rest in this world called the Sabbath is only temporary; but there is a permanent resting of the soul in the Garden of Eden in the afterlife the reward for all the works of kindness that was done in building the dwelling place for God in this world.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Law of God teaches the way of building the dwelling place for God in this world.It gives instruction what is the right way and warns against going in the wrong way.Children are taught by the parents and their educators the way of successful life.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religion gives instructions to people how to build their lives.Religion obligates people to follow its laws which is the law of God given by their prophet of truth.Judaism and Islam do not teach the way of spiritual freedom since it is only temporary and not the main purpose of life.The main purpose of life is to work to build the kingdom of God on earth.Spiritual freedom is connected to spiritual healing.There is a way back to the Garden of Eden but it is a very narrow path.The way to the Garden of Eden is protected by the whirling sword of fire and two angels.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When life becomes very difficult, and in these times when there is additional tension on mankind because of the threat of war, learning spiritual healing, has become more important even essential.Spiritual healing gives divine knowledge of the Garden of Eden which is hidden under the thorns and thistles sufferings of this world.The two angels guarding the entrance to the Garden of Eden are the two spiritual healers and teachers of truth the two representatives in this world of the two messiahs of truth which are in the Garden of Eden where Adam and Eve enjoyed spiritual bliss nirvana for a period of time which in unknown.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden for only a few hours before the sin.Others say after they were created on the sixth day they enjoyed the holy Sabbath which lasted a thousand years.With the help of God everyone will witness and delight some day in the Garden of Eden.The knowledge of the Garden of Eden which is received through spiritual healers is only a fragment of the pleasure of the Garden of Eden in the afterlife and after the revival of the dead.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin today to prepare for your extended visit in the Garden of Eden in the afterlife by doing good deeds.If life is becoming difficult and you need joy and happiness to continue your spiritual duties and obligations, take refuge in God through prayer or seek out a spiritual master a spiritual healer to help you get back on the way.Yoga literally means unity with the divine which is accomplished through doing deeds of kindness, learning scriptures and through prayer and meditation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karma is your obligation to build your life and correct your faults, accept it with joy as being given to you by God, your father and creator.It is also your obligation to be happy in your work where may come into your life the need for spiritual liberation moksha through the belief in the resurrection of the prophets Moses, Mohamed and Jesus.The work continues especially the work of every man who are called artisans of peace, builders of peace.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2019-01-09T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>David Wexelman</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y3.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04ET6W.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495XV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495XW.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495YA.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495XU.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y8.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495YI.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495Y0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y2.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495YE.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495Y7.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2019-01-09</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-07-09</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04ET6I</p></body></html>
