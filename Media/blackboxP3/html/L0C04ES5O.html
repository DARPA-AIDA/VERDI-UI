established in Mali in 2013, and has troops drawn from several nations.The troops are deployed across the country that has been facing serious security situations.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States, which is the biggest financial contributor to the organization, had questioned the validity of the mission.It contributes $1.2 billion annually.In June, the US had suggested that a plan to gradually end the MINUSMA should be implemented.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mali is struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency that has ripped through the country since it erupted in 2012.The insurgency has since claimed thousands of military and civilian lives.The violence in the country has since spread to its neighbors, Niger and Burkina Faso.According to UN figures, about 4,000 people were killed in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso in 2019, and thousands others displaced.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countries are members of the French-backed G5 Sahel group, a taskforce created by the

peacekeepers, as well as the national forces from the countries, the jihadist groups have stepped up their attacks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier in the month, after an attack on UN peacekeepers, UN

into the attack, while the head of the peacekeeping mission, Mahamat Saleh Annadif, condemned the attack, calling it a cowardly act aimed at paralyzing their operations in the area.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No militant group has claimed responsibility for the attack.However, it was similar to attacks carried out by al-Qaeda linked militants in the region.Attacks on UN peacekeepers are common in the region.Last weekend, an attack on the UN mission in the northern part of the country left ten peacekeepers dead.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attacks on UN peacekeepers are
