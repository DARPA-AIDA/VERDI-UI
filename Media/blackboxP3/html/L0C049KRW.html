official has promoted a conspiracy theory that the United States military could have brought the novel coronavirus to China -- and it did not originate in the city of Wuhan, as thought.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posting to his more than 300,000 followers on Twitter, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian republished a video of Robert Redfield, the director for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, addressing a US Congressional committee on March 11.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the clip, Redfield said some influenza deaths in the US were later identified as cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redfield didn't say when those people had died or over what time period, but Zhao pointed to his remarks in support of a growing conspiracy theory that the coronavirus did not originate in Hubei province in central China.He did not offer any further evidence for the claim.</p><p><p><img

brought the epidemic to Wuhan.Be transparent!Make public your data!US owe us an explanation!'the Foreign Ministry official said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of athletes from the US military were in Wuhan for the Military World Games in October 2019.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The video of Redfield was also published to Twitter by other state media outlets, including national broadcaster CCTV and the popular Global Times tabloid.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, Zhao's fellow Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said there were 'varied opinions' on the origin of the virus in the international community.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'China always considers this a scientific question, which should be addressed in a scientific and professional manner,' he said, avoiding questions on whether Zhao's tweet represented the Chinese government's official position.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian during a daily briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Beijing, on February 24.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts of Chinese social media, and even the country's government, appear to have launched a concerted campaign to question the origin of the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 125,000 people globally.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reported cases of the virus were in Wuhan, and since then the city has had more infections and deaths than anywhere in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking in his official capacity at a press conference in Beijing on March 4, Zhao told reporters that 'no conclusion has been reached yet on the origin of the virus' -- and Chinese scientists were still tracing where it came from.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 27, renowned Chinese infectious disease expert Zhong Nanshan also questioned where the coronavirus had come from.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The infection was first spotted in China but the virus may not have originated in China,' Zhong said at a press conference.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday, Hua Chunying, Zhao's boss who heads the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Department of Information, tweeted a link to Redfield's testimony, saying it was 'absolutely wrong and inappropriate to call this the Chinese coronavirus.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's ambassador to South Africa, Lin Songtian, took to Twitter on March 8 to say that although the first epidemic was recorded in China, it didn't mean the virus 'originated from China.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Zhao's colleague Geng cautioned Thursday that the origin of the virus could only be determined 'by science.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We don't hope to see anyone making an issue out of this to stigmatize other countries,' he said.'With COVID-19 developing into a pandemic, the world should come together to fight it instead of leveling accusations and attacks against each other, which is not constructive at all.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhao's comments are another example of Chinese government figures using Twitter to defend China against criticism -- despite the platform being banned in the country, along with Facebook, Instagram and a number of other prominent Western social media sites.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 2019, few Chinese officials had verified Twitter accounts.But since then, ambassadors, mission heads and Chinese foreign ministry spokespeople across the world have joined Twitter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming weighed in on the UK's decision on whether or not to ban telecommunications giant Huawei from its 5G networks on Twitter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the US, took to Twitter in December to deny accusations of human rights abuses against Muslim-majority Uyghurs in Xinjiang.'Ultimately, facts will always prevail over lies,' he tweeted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhao was promoted in mid 2019 after building a reputation for himself on Twitter as a fierce advocate for Chinese interests -- arguing with western politicians and blocking Beijing's critics -- during his time as a senior diplomat at the Chinese embassy in Pakistan.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headline and first line of this story have been updated to better characterize the claim by China's Foreign
