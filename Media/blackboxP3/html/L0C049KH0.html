from coronavirus?</h1><p>What factors put you at risk from coronavirus?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of factors affect your risk from coronavirus.We explain what this means and what you can do about it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With coronavirus still in the UK it’s normal to wonder how much you are at risk.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still learning about the factors that affect your risk from coronavirus and some questions still don’t have answers, but we have learned a lot since the first peak in the Spring.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do know is that everyone is different, and your own level of risk is affected by many different interacting factors including age and existing health conditions.Risk is measured by looking at death rates in large groups of people – it doesn’t mean that everyone in high risk groups will live or die.In some cases the difference in risk may be relatively small.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find out how to calculate

coronavirus</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fortnightly Heart Matters newsletter includes the latest updates about coronavirus when you have a heart condition, as well as support for healthy eating, staying active and your emotional wellbeing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’d like to sign-up</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that as you get older, your risk of death increases – both your overall risk of death (separate from coronavirus) and your risk of dying from coronavirus.Many studies from the UK and internationally have found that being older increases your risk of dying from Covid-19, and this has been strongly supported by analysis of reported Covid-19 deaths.Age is the biggest factor in your risk of dying from Covid-19.This could be because you’re more likely to have existing health conditions as you get older (which themselves raise your risk of dying from coronavirus).It could also be because the immune system doesn’t work as well once you get older.In England and Wales, almost all deaths involving Covid-19 occur in people over 45.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to reduce my risk?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t change your age, but you can reduce your risk of catching coronavirus by strictly social distancing (staying two metres away from anyone not in your household), as well as frequent and thorough handwashing.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a man</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men appear more likely to die from coronavirus than women.This has been the case across the world and in all age groups, (the only exception the over-85 age groups, where there are more women than men in the first place because women live longer than average).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many possible reasons for this difference between men and women, and the explanation is likely to be a combination of all of them.They include:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genetic differences may mean that women have stronger immune systems than men.The genetic instructions for some components of our immune system are located on the X chromosome, which women have two of, while men have one.For example, for cell receptors that alert the immune system when viruses, such as the coronavirus, enter the cell.So having a second X chromosome means that women have more genes involved in the immune system than men, although we don’t know for sure that this gives women an advantage in fighting off coronavirus.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female sex hormones may have a role in fighting off respiratory infections.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men may be more likely to have other health conditions.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence showing men are more likely to die from coronavirus comes from many sources, including an Office of National Statistics analysis of deaths in England and Wales, which found that the coronavirus death rate was nearly twice as high in men of working age compared to women.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: BHF analysis of ONS weekly death data</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another large study also found that men were twice as likely to die in hospital from Covid-19 - a pattern which was seen at all ages and with or without other health conditions.This information came from a platform called OpenSAFELY developed by scientists including Liam Smeeth, who is a BHF Trustee and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine.The platform allows analysis of over 17 million existing NHS electronic health records to look for patterns in patients who die from Covid-19 in English hospitals.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn what you can do to reduce your risk from coronavirus</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to top ^</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having an underlying health condition</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that having an existing health condition can put you at higher risk of complications from coronavirus.A recent study of 88,463 patients across the world in hospital with Covid-19 found that among their most common conditions were chronic heart disease (30%), diabetes (16%), chronic lung disease (not asthma) (16%) and chronic kidney disease (16%).Read on for more detail about how specific conditions affect your risk.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dementia and stroke</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People with dementia are at higher risk of severe illness from Covid-19.People with dementia living in care homes appear to be at particularly high risk of dying from Covid-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across all of 2020, there have been significantly more deaths among people with dementia compared to the 5-year average in both England and Wales.NHS England data also shows 18% of people who died in-hospital with Covid-19 had dementia—the second largest pre-existing condition following diabetes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don’t yet have a clear picture of how having had a stroke is linked to your risk from coronavirus, although more evidence is emerging.Stroke survivors have been shown to be at greater risk from complications from Covid-19.There has also been some evidence that Covid-19 may lead to having a stroke, which may be linked to increased blood clotting, but the evidence is still emerging in this area.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more about what coronavirus does to your blood vessels</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to reduce my risk, or my loved one's risk?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping your condition well managed could help to manage your risk.Take any medication you’re prescribed, attend any medical appointments you're invited to, eat a healthy balanced diet, take regular exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone living with dementia who has memory problems or confusion may struggle with the guidance, for example on social distancing and handwashing, that can reduce their risk of catching the virus.It’s important to pay particular attention to the guidance on how to stay safe and to offer any support that the person needs to follow the guidance.It's important that any paid carers use protective equipment like an apron, mask and gloves.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart disease</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's lots of evidence that having an existing heart condition raises your risk from Covid-19.Heart disease is one of the most common health conditions among those who die from Covid-19.Of the Covid-19 deaths examined in a British Heart Foundation analysis of ONS data for deaths between March and June 2020, ischaemic heart disease was the second most common main pre-existing health condition in deaths involving Covid-19 overall, present with 10% of Covid-19 deaths.Ischaemic heart disease includes coronary heart disease such as heart attacks, angina, or anyone who has had a heart bypass or stent procedure.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NHS England data also shows that 14% of people who died in-hospital with Covid-19 had ischaemic heart disease.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more about how your heart and circulatory condition affects your risk from coronavirus</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to reduce my risk?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping your heart condition well managed could help to manage your risk.Take any medication you’re prescribed, attend any medical appointments you're invited to, eat a healthy balanced diet, take regular exercise, and monitor your blood pressure regularly if your doctor has recommended you do that.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diabetes</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NHS England data shows that diabetes was the most common condition among people who died in-hospital with Covid-19 (27% of deaths), although this also reflects the fact that diabetes is a common condition.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OpenSAFELY collaborative found that having uncontrolled diabetes was linked with twice the risk of dying with Covid-19.This was supported by another large-scale study which looked at everyone with a diagnosis of diabetes registered with a GP in England, which found that both type 1 and type 2 were independently associated with increased risk of dying from Covid-19 in hospital.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of over three million people with diagnosed Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in England found that the risk of Covid-19 death when you have diabetes increases in line with the level of hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar).We can also see that since the start of April, the weekly rate of deaths in people with diabetes has been twice what it was before the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to reduce my risk?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping your diabetes under control could help to manage your risk.Take any medication you’re prescribed, attend any medical appointments you're invited to, eat a healthy balanced diet, take regular exercise, and check your blood sugar levels regularly if your doctor has recommended you do that.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lung disease</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While having lung disease won’t make you any more likely to catch coronavirus, if you do get coronavirus you may experience more severe symptoms.The OpenSAFELY collaborative found that having respiratory disease (excluding asthma) was linked with a little more than 1.5 times the risk of dying with Covid-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People with the following severe lung conditions are considered clinically extremely vulnerable (the shielding group):</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cystic fibrosis</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pulmonary fibrosis</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lung cancer and mesothelioma (with active chemotherapy or radical radiotherapy)</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;severe asthma</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;severe bronchiectasis</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit the British Lung Foundation for more information about lung conditions and coronavirus risk</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to reduce my risk?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s important to remember that a majority of people, even those with existing lung conditions, make a full recovery from coronavirus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a lung condition it’s important to closely follow guidance in your area, especially if you are in the shielding category.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find out the latest lockdown guidance in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also reduce your risk of catching the virus and avoiding complications by:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly adhering to social distancing</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limiting the contact you have with people</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shopping online or getting essentials delivered by family and friends</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washing your hands regularly</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing quiet times to go outside for exercise and avoiding crowded areas</li></p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asthma</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having asthma does not make you more likely to catch coronavirus.However, people with asthma may be at an increased risk of becoming seriously unwell if they do get coronavirus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is currently not clear how different types of asthma affect your risk.What we do know is if your asthma isn’t well controlled or is particularly severe, your risk of coronavirus complications may be higher.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to reduce my risk?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to adhering to strict social distancing measures, keeping your asthma under control is an important way to help manage your risk.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take your preventer medications as prescribed – this reduces the chance of your asthma being triggered by any respiratory illness, including coronavirus</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell your GP or asthma nurse if you are experiencing asthma symptoms 3+ times per week</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit Asthma UK for information on managing your asthma during coronavirus.</li></p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kidney disease</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that having kidney disease puts you at an increased risk of complications from coronavirus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The severity of your kidney disease has an impact on your risk – the risk is much lower for people with early or mild kidney disease.Severe chronic kidney disease (stage 4) is associated with very significant risk, while stage 5 (kidney failure) or requiring dialysis means you are considered at highest risk.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People with these kidney conditions are classed as clinically extremely vulnerable (the shielding group):</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you are on dialysis</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you have kidney failure (stage 5 chronic kidney disease)</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you have had a kidney transplant</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit Kidney Care UK for more information about kidney disease and your coronavirus risk</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to reduce my risk?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure your condition is well managed by attending any medical appointments you are invited to.If you are on dialysis, it’s important that you don’t miss any treatments.Talk to your doctor beforehand if you feel sick or have any concerns about your dialysis treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are in the extremely clinically vulnerable group due to your kidney condition, it’s important to closely follow guidance in your area.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find out the latest guidance in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also reduce your risk of catching the virus and avoiding complications by:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly adhering to social distancing measures</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limiting the contact you have with people</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shopping online or getting essentials delivered by family and friends</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washing your hands regularly</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing quiet times to go outside for exercise and avoiding crowded areas</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more information from the National Kidney Foundation about coronavirus and kidney disease.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down's Syndrome</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adults with Down’s syndrome are classed as clinically extremely vulnerable (in the shielding group) when it comes to coronavirus.Research looking at Covid-19 illness among people with Down’s syndrome has found that those over 40 appear to be more at risk compared with younger people.This difference in risk happens at a much younger age than in the general population.People under 20 with Down’s are much less likely to become severely ill with Covid-19.People with Down’s as well as a congenital heart defect, or diabetes or dementia, are particularly likely to need hospital treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are an adult with Down’s it’s important to closely follow guidance in your area, and to consider shielding if shielding measures are in place where you live.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get easy read information about staying safe in the coronavirus outbreak</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get easy read information about staying well and healthy in the coronavirus outbreak</li></p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High blood pressure (hypertension)</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence on how much high blood pressure increases your risk from Covid-19 is mixed.The data available only looks at people who have had a diagnosis of high blood pressure – not everyone with high blood pressure has been diagnosed, and some people with a diagnosis of hypertension may have had their blood pressure lowered by medication, but that’s what the statistics are able to reflect.The picture is complicated because, like many of the risk factors, it’s hard to separate from other factors such as age and having other health conditions.As more information becomes available, the picture may become clearer.But there does seem to be a link between high blood pressure and severe illness or death from coronavirus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A database of 88,463 across the world in hospital with Covid-19 show hypertension and the most common pre-existing condition, present in 30% of people.However, these figures don’t take into account other health problems that patients in the study may have had.It may be that people with high blood pressure were more likely to also have other health problems and that this affects the results.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another study that examined 44,600 patients using data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that hypertension increased the risk of death.But from this information we cannot work out whether the link would still exist once the effect of people’s age and sex have been factored in.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of 1150 Covid-19 adults admitted to two New York City hospitals found that hypertension increased the risk of death, but after adjusting for other risk factors this was no longer statistically significant.This is a similar finding to that of the OpenSafely collaborative.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures from the Office of National Statistics found that hypertension was a common pre-existing condition among men under 70 whose death was related to coronavirus.These were deaths where hypertension as well as Covid-19 were listed on the death certificate, so it seems likely that in these cases, hypertension was a contributing factor.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is difficult to accurately separate increased blood pressure from the increase in risk from coronavirus that comes in age, as your risk of blood pressure also rises with age.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to reduce my risk?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are lots of things you can do to improve your blood pressure.Which of these things would help you?</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being overweight or obese</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being obese is already linked to a large number of health problems, including heart and circulatory diseases.But regardless of whether or not you have other health issues, it seems that being overweight or obese increases your risk of dying from coronavirus.The more overweight you are, the greater your risk.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don’t fully understand why this is.Part of the reason may be that people who are obese are more likely to have other conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, which increase your risk of dying from Covid-19.But being obese does seem to have an additional damaging effect of its own.This could be because people who are very overweight are more likely to have breathing difficulties, for example because their lungs can contain less air and the muscles that support breathing are weaker.This can make them more likely to develop pneumonia, which is one of the serious complications of Covid-19 infection.Because the heart relies on the lungs to supply oxygen to the blood, breathing difficulties also mean the heart is under extra strain.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 27% of adults in the UK are obese (defined as having a BMI over 30).It’s less clear how much being overweight (a BMI of 25-30) affects your level of risk from coronavirus, although any increase in risk is likely to be smaller.More than a third (35%) of adults in the UK are overweight.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland from the Intensive Care National Audit Research Centre suggest that at least two thirds of people who have fallen seriously ill with coronavirus were overweight or obese.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study published at the end of April of 16,749 UK patients in hospital with Covid-19 found that obesity was linked to a higher risk of dying (around a 37% increase in risk of death).That study took into account factors such as age, sex and other health issues.The OpenSAFELY collaborative also found increasing risk of death in relation to how obese people were.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to reduce my risk?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There’s never been a better time to start losing weight, and anything you can do to reduce your weight is likely to help manage your risk.Aside from coronavirus, losing weight if you’re overweight will help reduce your risk of heart problems, of many cancers, and will reduce strain on your joints – so you can feel better and do more of the things you want to do.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you’re trying to lose weight, do it in a heart-healthy way that you can stick to.Crash diets don’t last, and you need a healthy balanced diet in order to keep your immune system working properly, which will help you fight off Covid-19 and other infections.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improve your fitness in safe, convenient and enjoyable way with My Step Challenge</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get our tips on how to lose weight and keep it off</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read our tips on staying healthy when you’re stuck at home</li></p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your ethnic background</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's lots of evidence that people of black, Asian and minority ethnic origin are more likely to become seriously ill or die from coronavirus.What’s harder to understand is how much this is because of factors such as deprivation, other health conditions, the type of work you do, and where you live.It seems unlikely that there’s a simple genetic explanation for the increase in risk.There certainly isn’t concrete evidence for a genetic factor that could be causing the differences in rates of severe illness or death.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to reduce my risk?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between your ethnic background and Covid-19 is not yet fully understood, and your risk of catching or dying from Covid-19 is affected by many different factors.Although there are some issues that affect more people of ethnic minority backgrounds, they do not affect every individual and we should be wary of making generalisations.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has launched an inquiry, through the race disparity unit, to try to understand the impact of factors that affect your risk from Covid-19, including ethnicity, gender and obesity and including a focus on levels of risk among NHS staff.The British Heart Foundation has welcomed this inquiry.We are also supporting the NIHR-UKRI call for research on Covid-19 and ethnicity; it is vital that more research is done to understand this trend and to find out what we can do to protect everyone.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more about why coronavirus hits people of BAME origin harder</li></p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your job</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of work you do seems to be linked to your risk of dying from Covid-19.This partly because different types of job come with different levels of contact with other people, and therefore risk of becoming infected.Certain roles may also be more or less likely to be provided with PPE (personal protective equipment).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that being a care worker is linked to a higher risk of death from Covid-19 illness – but being a doctor or nurse isn’t.However, these findings were not adjusted for ethnic background, socio-economic class or where you live.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst NHS staff are more likely to come into contact with coronavirus, an ONS analysis found that they are not at higher risk of death related to Covid-19, after adjusting for age or sex.But it remains that NHS staff from ethnic minorities have been dying disproportionately.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know socio-economic class can have an impact on almost every aspect of your health.The differences in between different occupations may be related to the risk of exposure to coronavirus, but that’s not necessarily the whole picture.Overall, men working in low-skilled or caring, leisure and other service occupations had the highest rates of death involving Covid-19, and managers, directors, senior staff and professional occupations had the lowest rates.This strongly suggests that socio-economic factors such as deprivation are also playing a role in these differences.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to reduce my risk?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not be able to change your job, but if you’re concerned, it’s a good idea to speak to your employer about your worries.You may be able to work from home, move to a different role, or temporarily stop working.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more about work and coronavirus</li></p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you live</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From early March to mid-April (when deaths were at a peak in the UK), London had the highest age-standardised death rate involving Covid-19 in England and Wales.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has changed rapidly in the following months, with the North West particularly affected in September and October 2020.The picture is changing all the time, but deprivation does appear to have an impact.In both England and Wales, the rate of deaths involving Covid-19 was nearly double in the most deprived areas compared with the least deprived areas.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking makes it more likely that you will catch Covid-19 and more likely that you will get seriously ill or die from it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s partly because smokers touch their face and mouth more, meaning that they can become infected more easily.And smoking damages your lungs, making you more vulnerable to severe illness from respiratory diseases including Covid-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some misleading headlines have suggested that tobacco or smoking may reduce your risk from coronavirus, or could help to treat it.It is true that some studies have found that smokers have a lower death risk, but that is likely to be more to do with the way the results were analysed and different factors were adjusted for – which can never be a completely perfect and reliable process.Even if smoking did have a small protective effect against Covid-19, this would still be hugely outweighed by the well-known harm smoking that smoking cause to your health.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to reduce my risk?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in the UK are already quitting smoking in order to reduce their risk of catching coronavirus.Aside from coronavirus, we know that within days of stopping smoking your breathing becomes easier, and within weeks your circulation will start to improve.If you need a time to quit, make it now.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get advice on quitting smoking</li></p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion: Living with risk</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are feeling anxious or worried about the effect of Covid-19 on your day-to-day life, you are not alone—many people in the UK are feeling the same way.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this outbreak continues to unfold, the evidence will grow and scientists will begin to better understand more about how Covid-19 virus works, how it affects our bodies and how to treat it.In the meantime, our priority should be managing both our mental and physical health.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s individual risk is different, and it is important to remember that an increased risk is not a death sentence.Almost everything we do in life comes with some level of risk – it’s a part of life.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you’re trying to decide what to do, for yourself or a loved one, you might want to consider your (or their) state of health, not just which of these risk factors you or they may have.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to read next...</h2></p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-27T00:00:00<br></p></p><p><p><strong>Content
