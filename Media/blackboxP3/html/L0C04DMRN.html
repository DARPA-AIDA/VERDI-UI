number is expected to increase as more households decided to abandon their pets due to the pandemic.These vulnerable pets require proper care and nourishment to survive comfortably.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These dogs can get the help and protection they need from animal charities, but people are encouraged to donate to dog shelters to help these organizations afloat.Animal shelters and rescue missions for abandoned and abused pets need regular donations from the community to continue their operations.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most dog shelters in India do not have enough resources to care for and feed all the animals under their care.It forces them to euthanize most dogs if they cannot find ways to generate resources, which is why donations for these organizations are badly needed.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal shelters can help you adopt a new pet anytime you are ready to take one at home.</figcaption><p><img

Kittens</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spay and neuter programs offered by dog shelters can be the most humane way to reduce the country’s number of neglected animals.It can help the neighborhood manage free-roaming dogs that may pass on various diseases or cause various accidents and animal bites.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose to donate to a dog shelter, you will be able to help the organization launch an aggressive effort to spay and neuter stray dogs brought into their facility.With the help of these programs, the animal shelters will be able to curb the increasing number of puppies on the streets.These puppies will most likely mature and get old even without a family to care for them, which means they can also reproduce and add more strays.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#2: Animal Shelters Educate The Society</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog shelters usually provide informative education programs for adults and children to know more about caring for animals.These programs aim to let people know the benefits of adopting animals instead of shopping for pets.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With proper education, more people will understand their responsibilities as pet owners.It will also teach them how to take care of their dogs to prevent them from straying.Most importantly, learning more about pet ownership will let everyone know about helping animals in the community.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#3: Animal Shelters Forge Unbreakable Bonds Between People And Dog</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dogs can provide unconditional love to anyone who takes care of them properly.If you visit one of the dog shelters in your community, you will see a number of dogs who are willing to shower you with love if you choose to give them a chance.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal shelters can help you adopt a new pet anytime you are ready to take one at home.They can help prepare the dogs for their new living conditions.The shelters can

resources needed to care for multiple animals, it can provide optimal veterinary support to all pets that they handle.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#4: Animal Shelters Serve As Haven For Pets After A Disaster</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pets also get affected when natural disaster strikes.Plenty of pets get displaced after a hurricane, earthquake, massive flood, or any other type of catastrophes.These organizations will do everything to ensure that dogs and other animals are safe and can return to their owners immediately once everything is settled.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since dog shelters also get affected by these disasters, they also need the community’s support to allow them to rescue and care for animals.It means they need donations of any form to continue their services to the animals in the community.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#5: Animal Shelters Help Improve The Health And Well-being Of The Animals And The Community</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a shelter has all the resources needed to care for multiple animals, it can provide optimal veterinary support to all pets that they handle.They can also provide more affordable veterinary care to those who will adopt from their facility.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will help prevent the rapid spread of diseases that usually affect animals.Also, providing adequate veterinary care to stray animals will help curb the spread of illnesses from pets that they can transfer to humans.It means that everyone in the neighborhood will be protected from serious diseases like rabies.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonus Reason: Tax Benefits</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on Indian bylaws, any donations to dog shelters or other nonprofit organizations through direct bank transfers of online transactions can get the 80G tax exemption.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donating to a dog shelter in India has plenty of perks for the donors.But the best thing about it is your contribution to help an organization raise and care for many stray animals can help solve the growing number of abandoned and neglected dogs on the streets.You will also help ensure that these animals are properly fed and

sleep:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleansing</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose a cleanser that keeps your skin soft and hydrated after washing.Stay away from high-foaming cleansers since they strip the skin and make it tight and dry.They can even cause lines, wrinkles, and higher sensitivity to the environment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick natural skincare products that soothe your skin without drying it.Clean your face no more than twice a day.If your skin is dry, use cleansers once daily.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serums</li></p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitamin serums contain A, B, C, D, and E vitamins that give your skin the nutrition and protection

customers first and the message you want to give them.If customers message you or comment on one of your posts, respond back to them and help them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customers will appreciate that you are quick to respond and that you are willing to help, and they will learn to trust you as a business or business owner.Some social media platforms even allow for the creation of a bot that can answer basic questions before directing customers to a real human.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so important to keep your customers engaged on social media even if they are not seeking help from your company though.Make sure that customers feel as if they are part of a greater community and that they can participate with you as a business or a business owner.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opt for

if you post information they want to know.Make sure that your posts are trending, and that you are always looking up what is important to the current user on social media.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the top hashtags on the sidebar of many of the social media platforms to see if you can relate your content in any way.This may even help you to go viral as customers will find you in search results with these top hashtags.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure that the content that you are posting is modern and is visually stunning as well so that customers are drawn in.Do not just use stock photos that you find throughout the internet and that everyone uses on their own social media pages.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus on photos that actually come from your business or that your customers have even taken of your business so that the information feels more personalized.Even give behind-the-scenes looks at what goes on when customers are not present so that everyone feels as if they are connected to you.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Thoughts</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social media is a powerful tool for anyone, especially a business owner.Make sure that you come up with an
