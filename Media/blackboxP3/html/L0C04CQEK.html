Corona beer!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's tough times for the unfortunately named Mexican pale ale.Google reports a surge in searches for 'beer virus' and 'Corona beer virus' supposedly indicating a causal connection between the two in people’s minds.Google Trends, which monitors Googlers’ search behaviour, lists in the top related searches to Corona beer, 'Corona beer coronavirus' and similar combinations.A recent survey by CBS news also reported that 38 percent of US beer drinkers who responded wouldn’t buy the beverage ‘’under any circumstances’’ while 14 percent stated they wouldn’t order it in a public place.Meanwhile the alcohol’s stock price had plummeted to an all time low in mid March...Actually, now might be a good time to get shares!</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-19T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Sarah Ollivier</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CQEN.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/svg/L0C04CQEM.svg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-03-19</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-30</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04CQEK</p></body></html>
