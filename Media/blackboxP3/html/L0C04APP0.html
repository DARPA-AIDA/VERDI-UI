Cima demonstrate the math that explains how a test’s sensitivity and specificity may combine with low population prevalence to make an individual antibody test relatively useless.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while individual results on antibody tests may not be particularly useful at the moment, antibody tests still have a role to play as part of a larger, population-level surveillance strategy that can tell us where the virus has been and how it is spreading over time.When used for this purpose, individual false-positive results matter less, because those errors can be factored out.The hope is that this information can be used to help local and state governments plan for the resumption of normal activities across entire populations, rather than one person at a time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news story has not been updated since the date shown.Information contained in this story may be outdated.For current information about MIT Medical’s services, please see relevant areas of the MIT Medical website.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-04T00:00:00<br></p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04APP2.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04APP4.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-05-04</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-21</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04APP0</p></body></html>
