person.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that influences all millennials, regardless of age or gender, is price.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the rise in the gig economy, most of them are paid

Millennials favor using digital payment methods over cash.This tech-savvy cohort will rather pay for their meals, clothes, and gadgets electronically.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tendency has been a massive driver for the e-commerce industry and an increase in the variety of payment methods.At-hand payment systems like payment cards, Venmo, and even cryptocurrency is pushing cash payments to the wayside.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s examine this trend and check why do Millennials tend to choose digital payments over cash.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first digital natives</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millennials are young adults and adults born between 1980 and 1996.By 2025, they should comprise three-quarters of the global workforce.As a generation with huge consumer potential and global spending power, they simply cannot be ignored when it comes to providing consumer and payment options.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact they’re the first 'digitally native' generation, combined with the abovementioned market impact, ensures they’re both comfortable using digital payment methods and that the market has no choice but to enable that trend.This forms a feedback loop that only increases the availability and usage of these methods.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photo by Anete Lusina from Pexels.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do they shop?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millennials actually tend to shop most in person.Just over half of millennials do their shopping offline, while a combined 49 percent shop on their computers or phones.Unexpectedly, the older Millennials are the ones who prefer to shop over the phone.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that influences all millennials, regardless of age or gender, is price.And it’s very easy to hunt for deals from the comfort of your home or on your smartphone.This explains the popularity of delayed payments among Australian Millennials and even Gen Z-ers.Snapping up a good deal is worth it, even if you don’t have money on hand now.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unsurprising, considering that the Millennials tend to have a poorer economic outlook than previous generations, so saving every penny counts.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ease of use</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor is the ease of use.Digital payments are much more convenient than their cash alternatives.In addition, there’s no need to hassle with banks, waiting in lines, and similar bureaucratic busywork that turns away the younger generations.The lack of paperwork is another often-cited upside, as most Millennials would rather fill out an online form (which they probably have saved in their browser) than fill out a bunch of forms.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash, while useful, seems to be going the way of the Dodo.As we mentioned before, Millennials and Gen-Zer who are strapped for cash at the moment but expect a payment at a later date use Humm buy now pay later in Australia or similar services to tide them over.The byword of digital payments is convenience, and swiping your card or your phone is always going to be more convenient than counting out change.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photo by Tim Douglas from Pexels.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They’re usually paid digitally</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important yet often overlooked aspect of why the younger cohorts prefer digital payment methods.Due to the rise in the gig economy, most of them are paid via digital means and simply don’t want the hassle of having to convert that into cash.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even people who aren’t a part of the gig economy often do freelance work and have found out that it’s convenient to simply rely on digital resources over cash payments.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coronavirus pandemic</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yes.This pretty much had to be there.Using cards and ordering from home has become more common than ever for all generations, not just Millennials, but the Millennials were the quickest to adapt to 'the new normal.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eschewing cash has become not only more convenient but also a way to preserve one’s health and protect others during the pandemic.The coronavirus pandemic has sped up the adoption of digital payments, and the Millennials were ready for it.Even with the vaccine rollout, the prevalence of digital purchases is unlikely to go down to its pre-pandemic levels, and businesses are changing accordingly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapping up</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this question seems fairly simple.Millennials are simply used to using digital tools to meet their needs, and it’s very convenient to pay for things digitally.Their desire to nab good deals
