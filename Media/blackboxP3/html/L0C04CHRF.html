markets are thriving — a highly unusual event that shows how the coronavirus has thrown all bets off.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why it matters: The disconnect adds to the wealth gap.The richest 10% of households — who own 84% of stocks — are getting richer, while millions of out-of-work Americans cross their fingers that pandemic unemployment benefits will be extended.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving the news: The equities markets closed Tuesday with their best quarterly performance since 1998 — the type of upswing that usually doesn't happen when the economy is in as precarious shape as it is now.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the jobs numbers released Thursday seemed like good news — 4.8 million jobs were created in June, and the unemployment rate fell to 11.1% — many of the newly employed were people returning to work at their pre-pandemic jobs.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as Axios' Felix Salmon points out, the number of 'permanent job losers' actually rose 25% in just one month.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it stands: After plummeting in March when the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, the stock markets have been rising — somewhat unexpectedly — for a variety of reasons.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve stepped forward with aggressive actions to flood the markets with as much cash as possible.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress passed extensive relief programs.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors remain flush with cash and need somewhere to park it (and the bond markets offer meager returns).</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expectations are that a COVID-19 vaccine will emerge, bringing things back to a new normal.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but: It's (still) the economy that matters most.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. GDP plunged 5% in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department, personal income decreased 4.2% in May, and consumer confidence — while higher in June than in March, April or May — is still well below pre-crisis levels.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a YouGov/Economist survey, only 10% of Americans think the stock market is the best gauge of the nation's economic health, while 37% say it's the jobs report (which — in a welcome dash of very good news — came in far more positive than expected on Thursday).</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roughly half of Americans own any stocks at all, whether directly or through 401(k)s or other vehicles.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Trump has taken credit for the exuberant stock market</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for what he describes as a burgeoning economy — despite the signs of economic shakiness.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Today's announcement proves that our economy is roaring back,' Trump said on Friday after the June jobs numbers were released.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'WOW.Record Growth in 2nd Quarter!Under Corrupt Joe Biden and his MASSIVE Tax and Regulation increases, Markets, and your 401k’s, will PLUNGE!Expect a Record 2021!'he tweeted on Wednesday.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in the business world fear a Democratic victory would usher in policies that could dampen the market: wealth taxes, a rollback of corporate tax cuts, climate change mandates for utilities and energy companies.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Democratic Party has a platform that is pretty much anti-growth, but those platforms can change,' Rich Sega, global chief investment strategist at the asset management firm Conning, tells Axios.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The stock market is looking toward the future.By next January, I think we could recover virtually everything that we’ve lost this year.'</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the lines: While many experts say that we seem to be past the worst of the pandemic's impact on the economy, rising case numbers throw everything into question.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The economy's fate is inextricably linked to the path of the virus,' John C.Williams, head of the New York Federal Reserve, said in a speech this week.'A strong economic recovery depends on effective and sustained containment of COVID-19.'</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heading into second-quarter earnings season, 'Nearly 200 companies in the S 500 have withdrawn their customary forecasts for the year, according to FactSet, and half as many companies as usual are providing quarterly earnings guidance,' per the New York Times.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought bubble from Axios' Felix Salmon: The S 500 and other big indices comprise the world's biggest companies with massive balance sheets and easy access to all the liquidity they need.The virus has effectively wiped out their small-business competition, so the giants now have the field to themselves and get to carve it up among them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they're saying: The disconnect between the economy and the stock markets is 'extreme,' Vikram Mansharamani, a Harvard lecturer who specializes in financial bubbles and business disruption, tells Axios.'It really does remind me in many ways of 1999.'</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Markets are not supposed to become inefficient,' Mansharamani says.'This is not supposed to exist, according to some academics.'</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portfolio managers are taking the long term view, staying put with their money while they wait for a vaccine.'Everyone knows second-quarter earnings are going to be horrific,' Sam Hendel, president of Levin Easterly Partners, tells Axios.'I'm looking toward 2021 earnings already.'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-03T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Jennifer A.
