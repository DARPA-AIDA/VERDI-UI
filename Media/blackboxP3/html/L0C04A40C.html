committed murder.Then after understanding the autopsy, that simply wasn't possible imo.Then the Sorros AG stepped in and really messed up the possibility of justice for anyone.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he should walk on the existing charges.This is not to say he did nothing wrong, he did but that's a different discussion/crime.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of what the jury does it looks like these people are going to commit insurrection again, and the state's official position will be to allow that.Meanwhile depending on where they act, the people might cut them down.Regardless, I'm not paying for their insurrection.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

want to stop gun violence (which clearly the Democrats do not), you merely need to severely punish those who use a gun in the commission of a crime.Here are four simple rules which would greatly diminish gun violence:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.One who brandishes a gun in the commission of a crime gets a mandatory 10 years added to his sentence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.One who fires a gun in the commission of a crime gets a mandatory 20 years added to his sentence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.One who commits a homicide using a gun gets a mandatory death sentence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.And any minor over the age of 12 who uses a gun in the commission of a crime is treated as an adult (no exceptions).</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

commission of a felony with a firearm have been on the books for decades.The gun charges are usually the first to be thrown out during plea dealings.Murder is already illegal regardless of the method used.What makes you think using or not using a gun will make any difference?Capital crime deserves capital punishment.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

attack on the Second Amendment.This is why anyone who uses a gun for any unlawful act, should pay the price for their action.By these courts not following through, these people are let free to do it all over again and again, then the politicians want to create 'new' gun laws that go after the honest gun owner.ENFORCE THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS!!!</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

some action that should deny them arms.CHo, the murderer responsible for the VA Tech killings had been declared insane by a VA court, the state failed to notify NICS.Roof was under indictment for felony drug charges, the state failed to notify NICS.Devin Patrick Kelley, the Sutherland Park Church shooter had been convicted of domestic abuse by a USAF court martial.USAF failed to notify
