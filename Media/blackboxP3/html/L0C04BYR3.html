Texas is pretty bad too.What are you seeing in your area?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard something on the news today that is very different than the first lockdown.They are talking about ticketing establishments like bars/restaurants for breaking capacity limits.They keep hinting that the fine is not enough.At the same time I'm seeing things that say it is our duty to order take out orders from restaurants.(which I find is weird) At least in my are a lot of those places are also seeing spikes in workers getting Covid.</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our school are all going virtual now

coronavirus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've said this many times here on ATS.the deaths reported in Japan are done through a police report.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are actual deaths caused by the coronavirus.I wish people would be more aware of the actual deaths caused by the coronavirus itself.And that's my good friends on ATS is a very very very low percentage of people dying of the coronavirus itself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edit on 1100000038192020-11-13T13:19:38-06:00193811pm1 by musicismagic because: (no reason given)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edit on

one freezer stuffed with food, another half way full, the cow will make all three of our upright freezers be full.Should get about three hundred pounds of beef from this half, giving out a hundred twenty pounds or so for presents, should be good for the year with beef.Usually we invite the kids over for dinner, but this year it may not happen very often, oh well, kids get more T-bones and Rib steaks this year to make their own dinners.Saves having to make dinner for a lot of people and cleaning up dishes after they leave....Hmmm, I guess there are some good points to this covid fear mongering.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is covid jumping up in the UP.It seems to be coming out of the border with Wisconsin a lot, but it also came from tourists coming her from downstate....they tried to get away from the governors lockdowns and brought it here where they could go to the bar.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edit on 13-11-2020 by rickymouse because: (no reason

parks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some places are going further,only allowing people in if you have the green 'low risk'status on the government app.We also have AI cameras monitoring social distancing,and some of the traffic cameras being re tooled to do the same.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its all a bit creepy IMO,and I will bet now that all the above will never go away even if the virus disappears-In fact with 5G it will become even creepier.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pandemic it appears,is the event that all the usual suspects have been praying to their dark gods for.They believe

weird.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes that's very true.and if you've been following my updates since March about Japan there's no ambiguity in my reporting of the number of cases and the fact that all cases of coronavirus and any deaths actually here in Japan are done through the police department.Local police department.So these figures of low deaths is one reason why Japan does not have a loss stating that a lockdown shut down or closed down whatever you want to call it is constitutional.We don't have a law currently that states it's legal to have a complete shutdown of the people's rights and privileges in this country.From an outsider looking in I guess at America especially since I'm an AmericanI can only see that well the rights have been long gone but the privileges of the American people are being limited through paranoia and competent governors incompetent local officials and whatever the case may be.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a little tip.We saw Las Vegas close down.Nashville city the city of music after Christmas and the holidays you'll see it closed down also.Right now Nashville has been hit pretty hard but people are refusing to abide by the common Sense laws of social distancing and practicing safe and standard methods of not trying to catch the virus.But tourism and the music industry is the main factor of music City just like gambling was for Las Vegas.Anyway the truth of the matter is we should be focusing on the actual true that's caused by the coronavirus itself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also one thing to take note of is that the lockdowns the shutdowns the people staying in their apartments the abuses and the unemployment rising leads to this one statistic that was published here recently.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 out of 10 people that have been truly affected by the above are now suffering from some type of mental disorder.Some severe some not so severe but they are suffering.That report is well documented in this country that I'm living in.More people are suffering on a daily basis because of the ridiculous lockdown rules.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm in the process of actually maybe copywriting this.THE CORONAVIRUS IS LIKE THE WIND YOU CAN'T GRAB IT AND YOU CAN'T CONTAIN IT.</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have to get on with our lives our daily lives are very important for not only our survival but our family survival our community survival and our nation's survival and you really realize this when you live on an island.America is a big country and unfortunately people don't see it the way Islanders see it other than if you go to Hawaii and they've really suffered due to 100% lack of tourism.anyway I'm not being selfish but I'm living my life the way I want to would take in all precautions against the stupidity of people that are actually out there trying to spread the virus and that people is very real.</blockquote></p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
