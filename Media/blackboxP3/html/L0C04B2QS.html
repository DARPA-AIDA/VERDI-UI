Geetha, a resident of Perungudi, a Chennai neighborhood.Residents who rely on private tankers scrambled to gather water in buckets and other containers prior to the strike.Some families temporarily stayed with friends and relatives in parts of the city where the municipal government delivers water.</blockquote></p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By The Numbers</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.5 million Population of Chennai.An additional 2 million people live in Chennai’s metropolitan region.In the past two decades, the city has grown by an average of 265,000 residents per year.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200 million liters Water delivered by Chennai’s private tankers each day.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,000+ Water tankers involved in the October strike, which involved an estimated 300,000 workers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25 percent Growth in Chennai’s private tanker industry since 2014, despite more severe groundwater restrictions.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On The Radar</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, Chennai’s water service has returned to normal.The future is uncertain, though, especially as the city grows and groundwater reserves shrink.Chennai is considering new water sources, including a desalination plant.The plant, which will likely be constructed in the next five years, would provide 150 million liters of water per day.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources and Further Reading</h3><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past Circle of Blue reporting on Chennai’s water crisis: A Torrent of Water and Concrete Imperil Chennai’s IT Boom</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In City Prone to Drought, Chennai’s Water Packagers Rush InRampage of Water and Social Entrepreneurs Push Chennai to Consider New Growth Strategy</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As groundwater runs short, water battles grow in parched Chennai</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Thomas Reuters Foundation)</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chennai faces drinking water crisis as packaged water units join tanker strike</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The New Indian Express)</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chennai water tanker strike ends, for now</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Hindu)</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OMR residents stock up on water as tanker strike looms</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Times of India)</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tankers’ strike: IT firms to face severe water crisis</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Times of India)</em><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2018-11-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Kayla Ritter</p></p><p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04B2QZ.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04B2R4.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04B2R0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04B2QW.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04B2R2.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04B2R3.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04B2QY.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2018-11-12</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-12</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04B2QS</p></body></html>
