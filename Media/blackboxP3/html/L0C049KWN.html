appalled at the number of idiots I see wearing masks outdoors.There is a reason why good household ventilation, as in opening windows or an HRV unit, is strongly recommended to prevent transmission of airborne viruses.Guess what, there is no better air exchange than being outside.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't wear a mask indoors either for different reasons.My understanding is that the dangerous version of SARs-2 shows a depletion of blood oxygen levels.Wearing a mask can also reduce blood oxygen levels, while failing completely to prevent you from inhaling or passing along any viruses.If I am infected and don't know it why would I want to give the virus a helping hand?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-12-25T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

the lamestream would like us to believe that being exposed to Corona is an automatic death sentence, but as usual the numbers paint a much different story.In Canada it's been established that even when testing those who have had extended contact, with a person who tests positive and has symptoms at the time of contact, less than 10% of those contacts test positive.That's extended contact, not accidentally coming within 199cm for a period of 3 or 4 seconds.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of Canada provides some fairly detailed total break downs.As of Dec 18, 2020: In the under 70 group it adds up to 376,627 individuals who have tested positive.Of these 12622 or 3.35% were admitted to hospitals, 3268 or 0.8% were admitted to ICU, and 1480 or 0.39% died.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limit it to under 60 there were 339,479 who tested positive, 8092 or 2.3% admitted to hospital, 1897 or 0.56% admitted to ICU, and 435 deaths or 0.14% of those who tested positive.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under 50 we have 281,326 who have tested positive.1.6% of positive tests admitted to hospital, 0.33% admitted to ICU and 0.05% deaths.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This of course is based entirely on the twin assumptions that the PCR tests are accurate, and that everyone who is hospitalized or dies with a positive test, is in hospital or morgue because of Covid.There are extremely solid reasons to question both of those assumptions, but you won't find them in the lamestream.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: All totals date from the beginning of the planed panicdemic.No age breakdowns, but about 20% of the ICU admissions were placed on ventilators.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-12-25T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
