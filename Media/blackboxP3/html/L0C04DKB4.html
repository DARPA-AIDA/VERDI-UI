A recent poll has suggested many Texans do not even know about this quid pro quo, or even about the recording.The main thing is that the ones that do know about it, they seem to have forgotten HD 83 Representative Dustin Burrows’ (R-Lubbock) role in this scandal.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HD 83 Representative Dustin Burrows.</figcaption><p><img

been accused by Sullivan of giving him a list of 10 GOP and Democratic candidates to target in the 2020 primaries.and that Burrows had said nasty things.Burrows came out in a statement on Aug 22, 2019, soon after the scandal came to light stating, 'I went in good faith' and 'What I can tell you is what I was there to do, and what I was there to talk about, and certainly those were a lot of the subjects that we did cover.'He also stated, 'I read the list off the cuff, I didn’t go in with a list, I just read these names in alphabetical order off my phone.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked if he had done anything wrong, Burrows stated, 'I have done nothing wrong criminally, and the Texas Rangers investigation will prove that,' which is true.The D.A. in Bonnen’s hometown concluded there was not enough evidence to press charges against Bonnen, but yet again, leaving Burrows out of it.But what is not true is that Burrows did nothing wrong.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s see what Burrows did do, with the release of the recording proving things said by Burrows.Said by Burrows in a recorded meeting:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We hate cities and counties'</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I hope the next session is even worse'</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But here’s the thing.I want to be very clear.I’m also not the guy sitting over there with Scott Braddock telling him shit, because I don’t trust him or like him.I think he’s sleazy.'</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They’re also upset because they’re being told to be upset.'</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I hope the next session’s even worse.'</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'So what I think the easiest way for me to say this, I pulled the vote sheet from Republicans who voted against taxpayer-funded lobbying and I’m going to go through the list of names and tell you who I think would flip their vote back on the good side.'</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Leave him alone.· · · · · ·He’s just a dumb freshman.'</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You don’t know my plan yet.'</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I’ve pitched this to the governor, I’ve started pitching this to some of my colleagues.Why don’t we just take the two local pennies that are being used for economic development and put those into driving down property taxes?We don’t raise anything, it’s already a statewide average, it’s economic development dollars, we hate cities and counties.'</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I guess we’ll have a Republican caucus meeting, hopefully, to elect the most moderate Democrat speaker and go to war.'</li></p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addison Perry-Franks is a 38 years old transgender female.She Came out to the public as a transgender May 2018.Addison has been Happily

equal.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the things that Burrows said, not Bonnen.Burrows read Sullivan the list of names, not Bonnen.This is very unethical for any elected official, especially a House Member.Burrows committed this unethical crime, not Bonnen.So why are we not asking Burrows to resign?Why are we only going after Bonnen?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a candidate for Texas HD 83 in 2020 against Dustin Burrows, I believe this was highly unethical, and no representation should be allowed to do this without having to account for his or her actions, this is nothing but corruption, and it needs to stop.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several People and House Reps, including Jay Leeson, host of The Other Side of Texas, have called for Burrows to resign.Yet Burrows states he can now focus on his campaign for reelection since the recording has been released.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we trust in Burrows after the multiple lies about the meeting and the statements he did nothing wrong?No accountability, no regret, no remorse.How can we allow Burrows to go freely ahead with no penalty for his actions?No punishment for the crime against ethics.How can the people of Texas trust a representative that openly lies to them when they ask if he was involved in the quid pro quo?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand with Texans.Stand with the people.Demand that justice be served.Let’s stand together and call for Burrows resignation for his seat.Click here for the petition to demand Burrows resign.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space
