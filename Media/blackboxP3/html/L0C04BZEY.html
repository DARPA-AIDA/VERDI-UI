immunologists and independent researchers have come to the conclusion that masks do nothing to slow the spread.Their voices have been silenced because their opinion doesn’t mesh with the narrative from the govt ministry of information.Countries such as Sweden did not have draconian lockdowns and mask mandates, yet their 'curves' were no different from countries that did.A very inconvenient fact that the media and our overlords refuse to acknowledge because it would totally discredit their agenda.We need a mass mask burning, people need to wake-up and reclaim their freedom and independence.If we don’t, our future is going to be very much like 1984.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-15T13:19:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Ken Danagger</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not agree with you more.These people that are obsessed with masks are aggressive and confrontational to those who don’t and afraid of their own shadow.They want to be told what to do and follow long like a puppet even thought it doesn’t make any sense whatsoever.Correct about Sweden – these numbers are all the same the majority of places.I was standing in line at the drugstore and saw a sign for SENIOR FLU SHOT and recommending people over 65 to have it as FLU IS DEADLY TO SENIORS.Yes, it can be.Now, are they requiring a mask for the FLU now?Come on.Let’s face it.If someone is older, obese, health issues etc, they are at risk for anything more than a healthy in shape person.Even falling on the floor or tripping or not as much stamina.Life is survival of the fittest.It is a bitch getting older – but this is a part of it.What – is everyone supposed to run around to wear a mask to what?Protect elderly of getting sick?If I am not wearing a mask and a mask wearer yells at me to wear one – does that mean that I am putting him/her at risk even though they are wearing one?Does that mean masks don’t work which is also social distancing is needed in addition to mask.All of this is illogical.Curfews are too.Does Covid only come out at night?This is all laughable.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

common problem with people who wear masks all the time.Like surgical staff, who regularly wear them for hours at a time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legit question: Is the irrational refusal to wear masks for the good of your fellow Americans really just about politics?Because it can’t be about freedom.Our right to freedom should not come at the detriment of our fellow Americans.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-15T11:59:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>BourbonAndStargate</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My you have o2 deprivation,

oxygen deprivation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Everett, if I have to do something to protect the health of others (especially at my detriment) then I should be able to dictate how they treat their health.Goodbye smoking, alcohol, processed junk/fast foods and hello exercise.Mandatory blood work also to determine the necessary health protocols are being followed.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted
