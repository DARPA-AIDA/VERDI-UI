high-profile right-wing conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones are doing the same.Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have tried to step up their efforts to curb misinformation linked to the virus, but hoaxes and conspiracies continue to seep through.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-02-03T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Ali Breland</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C736.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04C738.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C73C.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C73D.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C739.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C73L.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/gif/L0C04C73G.gif' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C73I.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04C73E.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C734.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04C73J.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C73F.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C735.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C73M.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C73A.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C73K.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-02-03</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-13</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04C732</p></body></html>
