which was studying bats in Wuhan - shut down in October, it was claimed on Saturday night.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;US and UK intelligence agencies were said to be examining the report, which adds weight to the theory the coronavirus accidentally escaped from the lab after jumping from bats to humans.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data report, obtained by the NBC News in London, said there was no phone activity in a high-security portion of lab from October 7 to October 24, 2019.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It indicates that there may have been a 'hazardous event' sometime between October 6 and October 11.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It offers no direct evidence of a shutdown, or any proof for the theory that the virus emerged accidentally from the lab.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LAB SHUT DOWN?</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there was such a shutdown, it could be seen as evidence alluded to by Trump administration officials that the novel coronavirus spread from bats to humans at the lab.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many scientists are sceptical, arguing that the more likely explanation is that the virus was transmitted to humans through animals in a Wuhan live produce market.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Health Organization said Friday it believed the 'wet' market played a role in the spread of the disease.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first case of the virus in China has been traced back to November 17, but researchers are beginning to question it, given that a case was documented in France in December.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The document says its analysis suggests the pandemic began 'earlier than initially reported' and 'supports the release of Covid-19 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology'.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;US President Donald Trump has previously said he had seen evidence that gives him 'a high degree of confidence' that the virus emerged accidentally from a lab.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American intelligence officials say they have not reached that conclusion and lack hard evidence to support it.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-11T09:59:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Tom Michael</p></p><p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3W8.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3W9.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/K0C03YJ1H.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../svg/L0C04AQCV.svg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../svg/L0C04AQCW.svg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3W7.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3WA.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3WB.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3WJ.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3WL.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3WO.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3WN.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3WM.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3WC.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3WD.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3WF.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04C3WH.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-05-11</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-13</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04C3W5</p></body></html>
