he said that everyone should wear a mask.He believes that the mask is a good protective measure.So, I think it's mean deceptive to instruct us not to buy respirators.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-27T17:39:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Barrett</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respirators are things that breathe for you.They pump air/oxygen into your lungs.They're recommending using personal protection equipment (or PPE), such as masks and gloves when dealing directly with someone infected as, yes, they do provide</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protection.But to say that</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be wearing masks in</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;situations will only lead to mass shortages where they are truly needed, and lots of misuse of these masks, essentially wasting them</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-15T23:38:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Timothy Peter Robb</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope.That's wrong.@Barrett is correct.You're thinking of a</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ventilator</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.According to NIOSH (and the usage that I have always heard), 'a respirator is a personal protective device that is worn on the face, covers at least the nose and mouth, and is used to reduce the wearer’s risk of inhaling hazardous airborne particles (including dust particles and infectious agents), gases, or vapors.'And your point about wasting masks is</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supported by empirical research.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-15T09:42:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Martin Videra</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your comment, Martin.You are quite correct on both points, while I have heard the term 'respirator' commonly used for what is actually a</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ventilator</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in my community a fair bit, I imagine this is likely a confusion of the term.And my ignorance on mask usage has definitely evidently been shown over the past few months.However, it is important to note that they're utter ineffective if they're used improperly, and</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are definitely a waste and a hazard (as they believe they have some measure of protection) to their communities.I wholeheartedly agree that we should be focusing on proper training on how to accurately protect yourself as much as possible without putting a strain on your local community's capabilities by respecting what you're able to obtain</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-22T13:06:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Timothy Peter Robb</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor in China was speaking from the perspective of almost 1.4 billion people a significant dense per square kilometer population</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-15T05:37:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>steelheader</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambiguity.Ambivalence are terms in English language. .Say something and contradict it with a following statement.I have seen several so called or self styled experts with this disease..I believe any protection is better than no protection.In unavoidable situations individuals may have to make masks of any available material and use them..Even if it be cloth or tissue paper and could be forced to disinfect and reuse those not visibly contaminated.Wonder what the poor and poor communities will be forced to do.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-22T09:52:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Neil Rangel</p></p><p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04ASQM.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-04-04</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-21</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04ASQJ</p></body></html>
