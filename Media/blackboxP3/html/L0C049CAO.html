no coronavirus samples were sent.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the Canadian media reports, the Chinese side has also never officially disclosed any information about the alleged virus transfer from Canada.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite clarifications, experts are not convinced.Amir Attaran, a law professor and epidemiologist at the University of Ottawa, was quoted by CBC News as saying: 'It is suspicious.It is alarming.It is potentially life-threatening.'</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts displeased by the Canadian Government’s decision to export the pathogens to China</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alarmed by the act, Amir Attaran said that the shipment was sent to the Chinese lab knowing that it has links to the Chinese military: 'What we know is that before she was removed, she sent one of the deadliest viruses on Earth, and multiple varieties of it to maximise the genetic diversity and maximise what experimenters in China could do with it, to a laboratory in China that does dangerous gain of function experiments.And that has links to the Chinese military,' Attaran said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the 'gain of function experiment', in which a natural pathogen is taken into the lab, made to mutate, and then assessed to see if it has become more deadly or infectious, the law professor furthered: 'The Wuhan lab does them and we have now supplied them with Ebola and Nipah viruses.It does not take a genius to understand that this is an unwise decision.I am extremely unhappy to see that the Canadian government shared that genetic material,' said Attaran.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Canadian officials have consistently denied any connections between the COVID-19 pandemic and the virus shipments and stated that there is no evidence linking the shipments to the spread of the coronavirus, given the fact that the pandemic is said to have originated in Wuhan, news of the 'policy breach' is a cause of concern.Especially considering that the revelation has come during the time when the diplomatic relationship between China and the West remains volatile.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While America has repeatedly blamed China for its campaign of 'disinformation' related to the coronavirus, Tobias Ellwood, an MP of the United Kingdom, in an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk, said: 'COVID-19, if it’s done anything, it has woken up the world to this rather aggressive and concerning the objective of China wanting to quietly advance its own influence across the world.'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-17T00:00:00<br></p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C049CAS.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C049CAW.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C049CAU.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C049CAQ.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C049CAT.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C049CAV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-06-17</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-03-17</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C049CAO</p></body></html>
