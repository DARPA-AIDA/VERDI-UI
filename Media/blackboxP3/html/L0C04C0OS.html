finally admits lockdowns are harmful, “doubling” global poverty</h1><p>WHO finally admits lockdowns are harmful, “doubling” global poverty</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Health Organization (WHO) has finally come to its senses in condemning the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns that it earlier supported, admitting that they in fact created a 'ghastly global catastrophe' by crashing the world economy.Speaking on behalf of the WHO’s United Kingdom envoy, Dr.David Nabarro urged world leaders in an appeal to stop 'using lockdowns as your primary control method,' and to instead allow people to live their lives as normal while encouraging the 'vulnerable' to protect themselves as they normally would.The only thing lockdowns achieved, according to Nabarro, was poverty, which makes them a no-go for countries that want to actually survive this crisis.Continuing to lock down businesses, sports facilities and other societal necessities will only lead to more misery, more poverty and ultimately more death, he warns.'Just look at what’s happened to the tourism industry, for example in the Caribbean or in the Pacific, because people aren’t taking their holidays,' Nabarro further explained.'Look what’s happening to poverty levels.It seems that we may well have a doubling of world poverty by next year.Seems that we may well have at least a doubling of child malnutrition because children are not getting meals at school and their parents, in poor families, are not able to afford it.'The WHO is right, for once Nabarro’s words are a stark contrast to those uttered by WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who back in April offered full support for lockdowns and even warned that lifting them too soon might cause a 'spike' in COVID-19 cases.At the time, Ghebreyesus had nothing but gushing praise for nations like the U.K. and France, which utilized lockdown and other 'tools at their disposal to tackle any new spikes.'Should the lockdowns continue, however, there will very soon be a 'doubling' in the levels of world poverty and child malnutrition, Nabarro warns.By 2021, poor people are going to become 'an awful lot poorer,' Nabarro claims.'I want to say it again: We in the world Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as a primary means of controlling this virus,' Nabarro further added.'And so, we really do appeal to all world leaders: Stop using lockdown as your primary control method.Develop better systems for doing it.Work together and learn from each other.'Nabarro made these and other statements just hours apart from other WHO officials issuing their own recommendations against any further lockdowns.The agency’s top emergency expert said authorities should avoid 'punishing' lockdowns that are worse than the virus itself.In Wuhan, China, where the virus is believed to have originated, extreme lockdowns were later shown to cause severe 'trauma' to city residents, not to mention the damage it caused to their local economy.Despite continued reported increases in cases of the novel virus, the WHO has joined the rest of the sane world in declaring that lockdowns are not the answer – not now, and not ever again.'What we want to try to avoid – and sometimes it’s unavoidable and we accept that – but what we want to try and avoid is these massive lockdowns that are so punishing to communities, to society and to everything else,' stated Mike Ryan at a WHO briefing in Geneva.Meanwhile, most Americans seem to be fed up with the continued hysteria over the virus which, generally speaking, is not the deadly threat that its promoters continue to claim it is.Perhaps now really is the time to put this thing behind us and move on with our lives.What do you think?More of the latest news about the
