lockdown for Britain.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi ATS.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain is about to go into a 3rd lock-down because we dared to mask up and go shopping!We DARED to hug a relative and go outside our homes.We're going to be punished and told off by the media, read all about it on the BBC, there's so much fear pron that they can fill an entire top shelf.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have all kinds of scary looking charts that show NOTHING!The media have also reported out R-rate is above 1!ARGHHHHHHHH!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were warned by the all knowing government (gaslighting us) that this would happen, we were told, 'If you're naughty and you go out AT ALL over Christmas and don't wear your mask at Christmas dinner, we're going to have to lock you down again'!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one word about Ivermectin, not one word about vitamin D or simple exercise making your chances of survival, basically, 99.9%</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope, it's FEAR, DEATH, OVERRUN HOSPITALS, R RATE ABOVE 1, 60 YEAR OLD MAN BEGS PEOPLE NOT TO MIX AT CHRISTMAS, TAKE THIS VACCINE NOW, NOW, NOW, NOWWWWWWWW YOU FILTHY EATER.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is anyone else sick and tired of this?Like to the extent that you're simply ignoring all of this now?I know I am.I work in an incredibly busy environment and NO ONE I know has this, knows someone who has had this, or suffered with this.The flu has disappeared too?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there are people who have died with this and from this (by an large elderly with co-morbidity).But why are we all locked down?Why are we all denied knowledge of Ivermectin and vitamin D?Why are doctors being marginalized and ignored by the governing 'powers'?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all political nonsense and it's making people insane.I made a thread a while back about this being a form of psychological torture and now I'm 100% convinced of it.Gaslighting makes people insane.The violence will increase and there is an undercurrent of rage forming in society now as people are tired of being treated like dirty animals that carry a disease.Trust is further eroding in a society that already didn't speak to their neighbors and people are afraid to go outside!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When does this end?What happens with all this?We're being told that even the vaccine doesn't work now because you have to wear a mask anyway.The virus is 'mutating' just like the flu does, yearly, but they're 'sure' the vaccine will still work.........</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going on ATS?What say you?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ii think this is training for the mark of the beast and the great deception, personally.Britain WILL be in another lockdown come January, I will stake my entire life savings on it, and on and on ad infinitum.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-12-18T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

that.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, governments have, for the most part, abrogated their responsibilities on actually making decisions to the medicos.And the medicos have only one thought in mind......stop the virus.They don't give two flying #s about your sanity, their job is to stop the virus and they will do that by any means possible....hence the lockdowns.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted

Hancock has refused to rule out imposing Tier Three measures onto the capital a week before Christmas Department of Health data shows infections in the city continued to rise during the four-week lockdown But NHS hospital admissions and deaths from the virus are still flat-lining despite the surge in infections</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to America on January

</i></strong>putnam6</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please understand this...</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only takes one person that is infected to infect a whole island.We seen this in Hokkaido.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lock down is only a temp solution.It's only a band aid solution.China knows this that is why they close the borders.With open borders its always will end up with lock downs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Zealand was on top of the game, do they still have lock downs?Do they still have infections ?If so, how is their tracking coming along...I would say quite well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why a country must close its borders for at least 40 to 60 days and combat the virus within.Does this work perfectly , NO.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tell yourself, live for today in a not selfish way.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-12-18T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

tests show false positive results in a huge amount of cases-Those non symptomatic cases?Bad test result.You can test positive if you only have a partial bit of the whole virus sequence-but that does NOT mean you have the virus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government are not interested in that though-PCR tests are their gold standard.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you test positive,have no symptoms-and then are hospitalised and die a month later when a bus hits you did you know you actually died of COVID?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that is how the government count covid deaths.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things just are not adding up-unless you factor in some huge secret unknown event which the governments of the world are secretly preparing for..</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't help feeling like a major hammer is about to drop</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-12-18T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

with this is the contagiousness and lack of symptoms leading to the much faster spread.That is the one thing that has blown this into something unreal and panicked authorities from the start.I think they figured out during that first wave that most people are easily controlled and they're taking advantage of it.That's the saddest part.</blockquote></p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

it.Conflicting information from day to day.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s mentally exhausting for so many people.On top of people being out of work, businesses closing for good, folks being isolated from one another, struggling to pay rent, utilities, and food.It’s just piling on.It’s going to come to a point where folks will just accept the edicts because they are too damn weary mentally to do anything else.They’ll accept more and more draconian measures in the sheer hope that it will even slightly ease their burden and stress.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are playing a game here that none of us is sure how it will end and how we’ll all come through on the other side.I think it’s by design and that’s so sinister that I can’t even wrap my mind around it.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

new 'Protection of the Police and Public Bill' which will re define what constitutes a 'serious disruption.'Its basically all about gving cops more powers to stop protests.And taking away more of the citizens rights to protest at the same time obviously.Which we won't get back of course.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;netpol.org...</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a

direct resources to those.The others are left to their demise aka probably dying if they decided that resources aint worth spending for them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there is no option to bring them to one of the hospitals that have very few COVID patients and still a lot of free ICU beds left.Like my hometown.They rather are left dying and elsewhere ICU beds are free.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the insurance determined that a transport isn't worth it.You now all know the price for a life, it's the cost of a ICU transport to a different hospital.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-12-18T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>ThatDamnDuckAgain</p></p><p><p><img
