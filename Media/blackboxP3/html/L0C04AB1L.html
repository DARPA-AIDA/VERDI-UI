Travel</h1><p>COVID-19 and Cruise Ship Travel</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the current situation?</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 2, 2021, CDC released a new phase of the Framework for Conditional Sailing Order (CSO, originally issued October 30, 2020) for cruise ships operating or seeking to operate in U.S. waters.This CSO is a phased approach to resuming passenger operations on cruise ships.The initial phase required crew screening to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 among all crew members currently on cruise ships in U.S. waters.With this next phase, CDC provides additional information related to agreements between cruise lines and port and local health authorities, updates to the color-coding system used to classify ships' status with responect to COVID-19 on board, and routine crew testing.Passenger operations continue to be suspended under the current phase of this Order.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, CDC still recommends avoiding any travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, worldwide, because the risk of COVID-19 on cruise ships is very high.It is especially important that people with an increased risk of severe illness avoid travel on cruise ships, including river cruises.Cruise passengers are at increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported on cruise ships because of their congregate settings where COVID-19 spreads easily.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can travelers do to protect themselves and others?</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDC recommends that travelers avoid travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, worldwide.For most travelers, cruise ship travel is voluntary and should be rescheduled for a future date.Do not board a cruise ship if you have symptoms of COVID-19, if you know you have COVID-19, if you were exposed to a person with COVID-19 in the past 14 days, or you are waiting for results of a COVID-19 viral test.If you are considering cruise travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, discuss this type of travel with your healthcare provider.Older adults and people of any age with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of severe illness if infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.</p><p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you go on a cruise during the

are returning to an international port or disembarking an international river cruise:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your return travel plans may be impacted.Foreign health officials may implement formal quarantine procedures if they identify a case of COVID-19 aboard your cruise ship.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you travel on a cruise ship or river cruise and disembark in a foreign port, you might not be able to receive appropriate medical care or be medically evacuated if you get sick.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some countries might refuse to dock your ship or allow passengers to disembark.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you return to the United States by air:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All air passengers coming to the
