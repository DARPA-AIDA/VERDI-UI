A Jan.29 article posted on the website Humans Are Free claimed the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation and World Economic Forum had conducted a pandemic simulation 'just six weeks before the real outbreak.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article then goes on to say 'that is one hell of a coincidence if you believe in that sort of thing.'It heavily insinuates the baseless claim that the event was conducted as preparation for the current coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Event 201 was a real operation, there is no evidence that it was meant to model or engineer the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event 201 and pandemic preparation</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event 201 was a tabletop exercise that simulated a global pandemic, which resulted from a new coronavirus.The program was hosted in October by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and World Economic Forum.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invite-only event featured medical professionals, policy experts and business analysts all focused on how different institutions would respond to the onset of a deadly virus.The fictional coronavirus — a coronavirus, in general, being a specific kind of virus — in the scenario killed 65 million people over 18 months.Joint recommendations from participants urged international cooperation both in preparing for and handling a pandemic.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Center for Health Security has hosted three pandemic simulations prior to Event 201, going back to a 2001 simulation known as Dark Winter.The October simulation was the first time the center included private sector actors in its exercises, in the hopes of modeling how they might also react in such a crisis.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Host responds to prediction claim</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise,' the university program said in a statement rejecting the claim that it predicted the current pandemic.'We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people,' the center added.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center further stated that the results of the scenario cannot be used to project for the COVID-19 outbreak because 'the inputs we used for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not similar to nCoV-2019.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origins and severity of the fictional pandemic differ from the current outbreak, as do the reactions of national governments and civic institutions.The disease in the scenario was 'modeled largely on SARS' according to recaps of the program.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a statement to USA TODAY, the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation cited several partnerships and contributions to pandemic preparedness it had increased since the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among them, the foundation stated it has 'supported efforts to bring more coordination and transparency to international collaboration on pandemic preparedness through other platforms, including the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GMBP) and the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Gates has been vocal in the past about the threat a global pandemic poses to human civilization.In a March 2015 TED Talk, Gates argued, 'If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic.'During a Vox interview in May that year, Gates also said, 'the Ebola epidemic showed me that we are not ready for a serious epidemic.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Feb.28 article for The New England Journal of Medicine, Gates wrote, 'In the past week, COVID-19 has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we’ve been worried about.I hope it’s not that bad, but we should assume it will be until we know otherwise.'</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ruling: False</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Event 201 was a real event affiliated with high-profile medical professionals, business leaders and government actors, the claim that the event predicted the current pandemic, or is tied to it directly in some way, is unfounded.We rate this claim FALSE because it is not supported by our research.There is no reason to believe that the current pandemic will resemble the Event 201 simulation, despite coincidences in the modeling and timing of the simulation.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fact-check sources:</h2><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-26T17:09:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Matthew Brown</p></p><p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-03-26</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-13</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04C3WR</p></body></html>
