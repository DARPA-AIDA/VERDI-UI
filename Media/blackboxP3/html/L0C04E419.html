Gen.Mohammad Husseinzadeh Hejazi, commander of the Quds Force in Lebanon, who is leading the project.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brig.

IDF communications with international media outlets, and for shaping the image of the IDF in the foreign public arena.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iranian officials have not yet responded to the allegations, but Lebanese Hezbollah has in the past denied any attempts to build precision weapons and says Israel is seeking excuses for offensive action.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israeli military has posted photos of the three Quds Force officers and Shukr on Twitter saying they are involved in the project.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Israeli military spokesman says Iran has been trying to transport guided missiles, especially from Syrian territory, to Hezbollah in Lebanon since the 1990s, but has largely failed; Conricus said the Quds Force has recently been trying to change its strategy.Moving key components to Hezbollah will upgrade the group’s conventional rockets and missiles to a guided missile with a precision factor of less than 5 meters.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel says the missile’s production, and production centers, are in residential areas and could endanger the lives of Lebanese citizens.'They are the ones who are complicit in endangering Lebanon and Lebanese civilians which Hezbollah and Iran are using as human shields,' said Conricus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also announced on Thursday that he is determined to 'thwart this dangerous project.'He warned Lebanon in Arabic, 'watch out.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Mr.Netanyahu also accused Iran of setting up guided missile defense centers on Lebanese and Syrian soil.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israeli prime minister then repeated the accusation during his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York, and outlined a plan that, he said, would show the three missile centers in Beirut’s residential areas.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, two drones, believed to be owned by the Israeli army in Lebanon, crashed in the Dahia neighborhood south of Beirut, which is Hezbollah’s base.One of them hit a building containing the Hezbollah media office, and the other exploded in the air and shattered parts of it, causing damage.Some Israeli media reported on Wednesday that what was targeted was an important part of Hezbollah’s missile program.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Hossein-Zadeh Hejaziis a military commander in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.He joined the IRGC in May 1979, and served as intelligence and security advisor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon, warned Israeli forces in response to the incident that they were ready to respond 'imminently.'He also said that Hezbollah has entered a new phase of confrontation with Israel.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lebanese army announced Wednesday that it had shot down an Israeli drone.Israel responded by saying that its equipment had not been damaged.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lebanese Hezbollah group and its military are two separate military forces, and the Lebanese military has received more than $ 1.5 billion in US government assistance since the 2008 war.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States is working to strengthen the Lebanese army by creating a deterrent against Hezbollah’s military power.But Israel says the Lebanese army is very close to Hezbollah.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Israeli military spokesman responded that the Lebanese army (not Hezbollah) fired on the Israeli drone, saying its country’s policy towards the Lebanese army had not changed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We continue to classify Hezbollah as our main enemy and the Lebanese Armed Forces as a potential enemy,' Conricus said.'If they fire at Israel, tactically speaking, then that specific force on the ground will be considered an active enemy, but strategically speaking Hezbollah is the enemy.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remains

ritual by the Chimú culture as an appeasement to their god, Shi, and mitigate the effects of the El Niño phenomenon.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of archaeologists excavated the remains of 227 children on the north coast of Peru.The minors, experts say, would most probably have been sacrificed by the Chimú culture to placate their gods and so lessen the conditions of the El Niño phenomenon.In fact, the remains found show signs of death during wet weather.This would be the world’s largest child sacrifice, according to Feren Castillo, the archaeologist at the National University of Trujillo.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chimú culture was centered on Chimor with the capital city of Chan Chan, a large adobe city in the Moche Valley of present-day Trujillo, Peru.In the last 20 years, archeologists have discovered several sites of adult and child sacrifice dating to the 14th and 15th centuries.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archaeologists worked since 2018 in Huanchaco, site of the sacrifice, and the third-largest city in the country.'This is the biggest site where the remains of sacrificed children have been found,' chief archaeologist Feren Castillo told AFP on Tuesday.'There isn’t another like it anywhere else in the world.This thing is uncontrollable with children.Wherever you dig, there is another one,' he added.The skeletons were found in a position facing the sea.Some of them still had traces of skin and hair.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first finding of this type in Huanchaco and its surroundings, as it is a significant settlement of the Chimú.In Pampa la Cruz, a municipality near Huanchaco, a pit with 56 skeletons was found in June 2018, while in Huanchaquito, near the city, remains of 140 children were found.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Definitely, Huanchaco is the place chosen to make these sacrifices,' said Castillo.This site is located about 300 meters above sea level, in the middle of an expanding residential housing complex and still continues to suffer from climatic conditions and the devastating effects of the El Niño phenomenon.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El Niño is the warm phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and is associated with a band of warm ocean water that develops in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific.It was named by Peruvian fishermen after the newborn Christ.El Niño may have led to the demise of several pre-Columbian Peruvian cultures.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remains found belonged to minors aged between 4 and 14 years old.The skeletons also had injuries on their ribs that were probably caused by knife cuts.The battered ribs indicate, according to the group of archaeologists, that the sacrificers apparently extracted the hearts of the poor children for the rituals.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chimú civilization extended along the Peruvian coast all the way to Ecuador, but faded off in 1475, after it was conquered by the Inca empire, which in turn fell to the Spanish conquistadors.It essentially depended on agriculture, so it looked for all the ways to keep its crops from being affected by the rains.They worshiped the moon god, whom they baptized as Shi, and unlike the Incas, they believed that this was more powerful than the sun.The chronicler Fray Antonio de la Calancha described these offering rituals in 1638 and said they used to be done during lunar eclipses, along with fruit offerings and colored fabrics.According to archaeologists, more corpses could still be found in the area.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on
