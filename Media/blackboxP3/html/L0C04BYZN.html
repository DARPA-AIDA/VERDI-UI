people continues to grow.</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jameson said: Ok if not, what would you recommend for the US if the infection rate of a new virus was 5x?That is to say that on average 1

virus, regardless of the infection rate, I recommend that the government</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recommend</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quarantining the elderly and the immuno-compromised, as well as practice social distancing and hand washing.I do not believe it is the job of the government to save us from this virus at all, and it is certainly not the job of the government to trample on regular human rights in response to it.I'm not in favor of any government mandates whatsoever in regards to COVID.Recommendations, sure.Right now, the states' governments' attitudes have tended to be that the people are idiots, and they have to force people to do certain things or not.These precise practices of quarantining at-risk populations, social distancing, and hand-washing, seem to be supported by data.General lockdowns do not appear to be supported by data.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the state governments, I am for the limited government of the people, by the people, and for the people.The job of the government is basically to write, interpret, and enforce just laws, and to defend the country against outside attack.The vast majority of other tasks that governments do aren't chartered, they're unconstitutional, and are hence over-reaches.The government has gotten too big for its britches.Give me liberty or give me death!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People die of things every day, whether it's COVID or not.The current extremely unbalanced approach to COVID (the COVID death toll hasn't begun to approach other big killers like heart disease or cancer, or even the flu) tells me something is amiss.Conspiracy theories are quite easy to justify in situations like this: there is a correlation between how socialist/communist a state's governor is, and how draconian the lockdown measures are in that state.My state of Minnesota is pretty ridiculous: Governor Walz is a borderline communist, and what we see is an extreme reluctance to give up his emergency powers, along with a constantly changing goalpost (that's been made fun of in political cartoons) that, for example, Mayo Clinic, where I work, has constantly been either satisfying or anticipating.That, of course, doesn't imply that socialist/communist governors cause more draconian measures.But we remember that the new causal revolution shows that the statement 'Correlation does not imply causation' should give way to 'Correlation sometimes implies causation', or even 'No correlation without causation.'That needs to be properly understood, of course.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

we have a vaccine for the flu.</blockquote></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, sort of.The flu vaccine is equivalent to rolling the dice.It's a guess as to which three strains the vaccine manufacturers think are going to be the most prevalent in the next season.It's not an effective vaccine (look at comparing the number of people who got the vaccine and still got the flu, and also compare with those who did not get the vaccine and either got or did not get the flu), and it also has a large number of adverse reactions listed (see the vaccine insert published by the manufacturer).The flu vaccines do not appear to have used aborted fetal cell lines in their development, so I wouldn't have an issue there.I do have insurmountable ethical objections to using any vaccine developed using aborted fetal cell lines.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize heart disease and cancer are not contagious, but my point was more about the sheer size of the hullabaloo surrounding COVID versus cancer and heart disease and the flu.Different diseases, of course, require different approaches, I get that.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

but contemplative and on level of individual opinions, overwhelmingly insignificant.</blockquote></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet again, we are, apparently, in radical disagreement.What is right and wrong is orders of magnitude more important than what is possible, or who has power, or who doesn't have power.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't make sense to debate on higher levels when the disagreements are more fundamental.I am a Christian, I believe that the Bible is the inspired, inerrant, infallible word of God.It is the only ultimate rule of faith and practice.Truth has absolutely nothing to do with who is talking.Truth is the set of all archetypes in the mind of God; a statement is true if it is one of those archetypes, and false otherwise.That is, God defines truth.Truth is not defined by oppressor/oppressed class status, a la Karl Marx/critical theory/intersectionality, all of which I reject nearly categorically.About the only thing those theories get right is that, at various points in the past, some people have oppressed others.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as God defines truth, he also defines what is right and wrong - what is right is inherently bound up in God's character.He is literally unable to do evil or wicked things.As God made all things, and he made all people, he has all authority, and we are answerable to him for whether we do right or whether we do wrong.And, as our ultimate destiny in the judgment is far more important than temporal consequences now (which even then are not completely unimportant), and our destiny is affected by right and wrong far more than power, I stand by my claim that what is right and wrong is far more important than power.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
