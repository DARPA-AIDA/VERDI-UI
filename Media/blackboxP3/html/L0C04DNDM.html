Christian Democrats and the Green Party.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Germany has a leading economy within the EU members.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that she will not lead her Christian Democratic Union into the upcoming election this September.Chancellor Merkel has been in power for the past sixteen years, and leaves a legacy of leading the largest economy within the European Union’s member states.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angela Dorothea Merkel is a German politician serving as Chancellor of Germany since 2005.She served as the leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 2000 to 2018.</figcaption><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495YI.png' style='max-width:

and possibly lead the country into their 90s.Personally, I do support an age limit regarding the eligibility to run for the leadership role.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Canada elects younger leaders, including the current Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.Currently, Prime Minister Trudeau is in his second term at 24 Sussex.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Chancellor Merkel could be leaving the leadership position due to feeling confident that Germany has a secure future.The US is safe for the EU, since Joe Biden has been elected as the next President of the United States.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chancellor Merkel is an internationalist, and her views align with the Biden camp.President Donald Trump has not been favored by the EU, and even managed to cause tensions with super-friendly Canada.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Chancellor Merkel is blamed by some for the rise of crimes in Germany and the large number of refugees that were allowed to enter by the government.Some say many have not been vetted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of Ukrainians also received status in Germany under false pretenses and are collecting social services.There were rumors that the Merkel government feels guilty regarding the occurrence of the Maidan Revolution in Kiev.Germany had a large influence over the Orange Revolution in Ukraine.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, many believe that Chancellor Merkel should have stepped down awhile back, and allowed for a change of leadership, and perhaps accepted a secondary role within the Bundestag.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jens Spahn is a German politician currently serving as Federal Minister of Health in the fourth Merkel cabinet.He is a member of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU).</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, who will be Angela Merkel’s successor?It is plausible that the individual would have to be approved by Chancellor Merkel.To note, Chancellor Merkel has lost a lot of support within her party in the past two years.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, there were three candidates named that could have replaced Chancellor Merkel.They were Norbert Röttgen, Armin Laschet, and Friedrich Merz.This year, Jens Spahn has been added to the list of possible candidates.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the new candidate would not be able to shake up the party or change the course of German politics.The party is a conservative party, but it has a lot of liberal policies.It is highly likely that the new chosen candidate will be announced this spring.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Union has a double-digit lead in the latest opinion polls, forming the next government will be difficult.There is a good chance there would be a coalition formed with the Green Party in Germany.The Greens will win seats in the next Bundestag, and may even finish second for the first time in their history.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a certainty that Germany will not have a tide of the populist movement highjacking the German political course.Germany is relatively safe and there are no indications of major changes within German political elites.Within the EU, Germany continues to be the leader and their position will not change in the near future.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
