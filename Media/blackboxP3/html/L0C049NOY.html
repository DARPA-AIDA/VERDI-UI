those of you willing to help me out here.I couldn't find any articles online about swimming pools and the virus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just discovered the first case in my country.She's been travelling all over the country before she showed symptoms apparently.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone know</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if it can be transmitted from the person next to me when I'm swimming?We can't wear masks in the pool so</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does anyone know</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what precautions should we take?</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your opinion</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should people stay out of the pool completely?What do you plan on doing?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>u/guerillagurl19</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m an epidemiologist, I have zero knowledge of the nature of the coronavirus, full disclosure; however, with the standard treatment that goes into most swimming pools, I’d say it’s unlikely for any virus to survive long in such an environment.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>debacchatio</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dude I use your job in hang man all the damn time, thank you for being you</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Mook12627</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks!That's useful info.I still can't decide between if I should go ahead this evening but be cautious or just wait a few days and see what people come up with though.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>guerillagurl19</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on latest information, Is it safe to swim in the local gym and use sauna?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>anxietyokra</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you are in China or swim with someone who has recently been to China then you really don't need to worry about this virus at all.it has not spread enough to be a concern for most people and taking your normal flu precautions will be more than enough to protect yourself from infection.stay home if your sick, wash your hands, don't cough in peoples faces.everything is going to be fine.Don't let the alarmist 24/hour news reports start a panic.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>allmightygriff</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks!Really needed to hear this.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>guerillagurl19</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only this was still the case...</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>HSpartaL</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goddammit.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>jbwilso1</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only this were still the case lol</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found this thread while googling if it was safe to swim in pools D:</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>HiILikePlants</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So.I did my undergraduate in Microbiology and am getting ready to start a PhD in Microbiology as well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I've read about the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as it's been named, is a respiratory virus.So it's transmitted through ways like coughing and air droplets.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't believe you'll be able to get it from a pool because the chlorine levels are likely too high for the virus to spread, but unless you are in mainland China, or there are local cases, you shouldn't need to worry about it too much.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said.I'm not a doctor and no one really knows much about this virus</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>thenormalmormon</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's very true -

I have no idea.But the idea that the sanitation agents in pools kill anything that could get you sick is false.They kill most things I’m guessing.But illness spread by pools isn’t unheard of.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>syelnats</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's a lot more likely you're going to get MRSA in the locker room when you're changing.The chlorine in the pool purposely creates an environment antithetical to viral, bacterial, and fungal life.Hell, it's literally melting our skin off when we're in it.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>damnlooneyhats</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uhhhhhh I’m sorry but I chose this thread to analyze this morning, and I’m finding all sorts of statements inconsistent with reality.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without *diving* into some Chemistry lessons, and I truly apologize for punning it up in here, but chlorine cannot do anything on purpose or by accident.But that’s not even my main concern with your statement.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m more concerned that YOU are PURPOSELY swimming in a pool that melts your skin.Apparently repeatedly too, as you don’t seem all that concerned with it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said (albeit unnecessarily...) if you are or have been swimming in a pool of magma, I’d highly advise that you cease to do so.ASAP.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, getting back on topic here: no.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, Coronavirus could not live in a pool of liquid hit magma.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that the OP’s question?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>OneGratefulDawg</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a discussion about it.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>tbfi7</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>guerillagurl19</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That made for interesting reading 🤢</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>jujhar5</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve been swimming everyday since it happened and it’s been fine</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>the-four-horseman</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah I don't want to stay out of the pool so I'll probably follow suit honestly.Unless there's a lot of evidence that swimming is dangerous.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any cases in your country?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>guerillagurl19</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, chlorine kills most/all bacteria and viruses</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>quebecoisejohn</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep.Just want to add that it doesn't appear to kill them instantly, but rather to take time, depending on the bacteria/virus in question:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.seeker.com/gross-germs-that-can-survive-in-pool-chlorine-1974879569.html</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>walker1555</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live in SINGAPORE.The pool in my condo has been closed due to panic.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>milesgehm1</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no cases in Singapore yet right?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>guerillagurl19</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read to avoid swimming since the virus could be spread through the eyes and water inevitably gets in/around your eyes when swimming.But there wasn’t detailed information about whether the virus could survive in pool water</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Seattle4412</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C049NMS.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-04-07</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-08</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C049NOY</p></body></html>
