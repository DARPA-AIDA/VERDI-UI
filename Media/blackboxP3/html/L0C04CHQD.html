Chart: Naema Ahmed/Axios</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second quarter, the median estimate for S 500 companies' earnings per share declined by 37% while the index gained nearly 20% in price, according to data from FactSet.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earnings decline is on pace to be more than 10 times the average decline in bottom-up EPS estimates over the past 10 years and the largest in a quarter since FactSet began tracking the data in 2002.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous record was -34.3% in Q4 2008.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoom in: All eleven sectors recorded a decline in their bottom-up EPS estimate during the quarter, led by the Energy (-488.0%), Consumer Discretionary (-122.5%), and Industrials (-85.7%) sectors.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of note: 'So far this year, the five largest stocks on the S 500 — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon — have rallied double digits, but just one of the 50 smallest S 500 is in positive territory,' per CNBC.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last word: It's not really about the fundamentals anymore.'Next year when governments are not responding and the problem’s behind us, I suspect that the level of optimism will grow but that’s actually a less attractive time to be in equities,' Morgan Stanley's Slimmon says.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You’ve seen this movie before;
