saying there are no good reasons not to wear a mask; for example, emphysema, COPD and severe asthma are conditions that might be exacerbated by slightly reduced airflow to the lungs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the vast majority of Americans are healthy enough to wear a mask for extended periods without any issue at all.Also, if enough people wear them, we will start

two masks.The purpose of wearing two masks is to increase the filtration capability.The theory is that two masks will filter better than one so you will be better protected from the virus.You can either wear two masks or upgrade to a mask that will do the same job as two.Dr. Basser who is the former head of the CDC said that you should consider upgrading to the N95 mask instead of wearing two masks.So its either two masks or one mask that will do the same thing.I think that wearing an N95 mask is better than wearing two masks for two reasons.The N95 mask wa</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend that the general public wear N95 respirators to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including coronavirus (COVID-19).The
