platform.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of content-specific goals and objectives and plans for the distribution of your content.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your social media content strategy should flow naturally from your social media objectives.Ask yourself how you’ll use content tactically to attain broader social media objectives.For example, if a social media objective is to extend brand recognition with millennials by 30%, your content strategy might specify a posting rate for Snapchat and embody plans for influencer takeovers Instagram live giving you more opportunities to connect with your target market.In addition to supporting your social media strategy, your content should also support and align with your organization’s general content approach, provided one exists.There are four key parts of a social content strategy.Research and analysis of current content perception and strategy, your target audience identified by platform, a list of content-specific goals and objectives and plans for the distribution of your content.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research is the key to understanding what content can resonate together with your audience.Begin by observing your social media audit then use specific tools like Facebook’s audience insights and Twitter analytics to spot your audience demographics.Remember to treat each network’s following as unique audience as your Instagram audience may be different from your following on Twitter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyze the reception of previously posted content.Find specific samples of the most effective engaging post and build an inventory for every network.This will help you identify the types of content and supporting copy that is succeeding on each channel.Maybe your top performing content on Twitter is an educational-how-to post but your Instagram followers engage more with inspirational posts.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tailor your content strategy to what’s productive on every network and do not assume that one size fits all.To dig even deeper into content performance, connect with your audience directly.Consider posting polls to find out what varieties of content your audience would love to visualize within the future.For example, if you run a weekly Twitter chat you could post a poll asking your participants would like to chat about next.The results are not going to mainly offer you with good ideas for content but as well as with insight into your audience’s desires.Working in tight collaboration with content creators in your organization like your copywriters and marketing team necessary for achieving social media objectives.Be sure sure to share insights on content performance early in the content creation process so it influences the content being created.This will, in turn, present the social media team with shareable material most probably to resonate among target audiences.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next up is competitive analysis.Looking at what your competitors are posting could possibly be an excellent reference for inspiration.Just be sure not to copy your competitors content.Look closely at the categories of topics your competitors are covering and the ones that aren’t.Is there a possibility for you to fill a content gap and gain specific niche market?.Having researched your target audiences and selected a widely used content, it is time to establish some goals.When setting up goals, it is the best way to create overall content performance goals as well as further specific goals for individual types of content.For example, an overall social media objective might be to increase traffic to a landing page from Facebook by 20% in Q1.A corresponding content goal might possibly be to share ten white papers in Q1 that generate an entire 3000 of click-throughs to that particular landing page.The final piece of your content strategy is your plans for distribution.Consider what types of content you’ll be sharing on which platforms and how often.When choosing what to post where a look back to social media audit and use specific content research taking into account what types of content have performed best as well as upcoming and current content trends such as live video while your content may change based on network, it’s important that your overall tone and brand voice remain consistent.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, build a regulation for the pacing of your content distribution.The frequency during which you select to post must be tailored to your organization.We recommend that you test posting frequency for each of your networks in order to determine what works best for your brand.For example, if engagement consistently drops after your third daily Facebook post that could be an indication that two posts per day are appropriate for your audience.Make sure that you’re considering frequency on a per network basis as engagement thresholds are guaranteed to differ.Your content distribution guideline is going to be a valuable tool once you begin operating with monthly and weekly content calendars by having current goals for the amount and kinds of posts you will be shared per day.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can begin charting out your content calendars in advance of having specific copy drafted this will help you determine how much content you’ll need to curate or create from scratch to support your goals.As with all strategy documents, ensure you’re creating them in a way that provides value to you and your team.Creating these documents isn’t an academic exercise, they should be something that you can continually look to for guidance, not created and then forgotten.We suggest that your methods are saved in a digital format which will be operational and accessible for your entire team like Google Doc and keep a backup bookmark in your browser for easy access.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted
