due to the increasing adoption of virtual routers in countries like France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, followed by the remaining countries of Europe.Some key market players are based in Europe too.During the forecast period, the Asia Pacific region is expected to rise as the fastest growing regional market due to growing penetration of network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) in countries such as China, India, Japan, and Singapore, followed by the remaining countries of Asia Pacific region.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RoW segment covers the countries of Latin America and the Middle East Africa (MEA).Latin America is a small market because the availability of advanced technology is limited in this region.Argentina and Brazil are two strong economies that have the potential to rise as lucrative markets in the future.In the MEA region, the market is small due to poor countries, lack of education, lack of awareness, lack of skilled professionals, and lack of technological advancement.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latest Industry News</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excitel Broadband, a high-speed Internet Service Provider (ISP) in India has
