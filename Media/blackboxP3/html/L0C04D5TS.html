Liquid Discharge Market to Touch $1 Billion Valuation by End of 2025</h1><p>Zero Liquid Discharge Market to Touch $1 Billion Valuation by End of 2025</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing global crisis of freshwater.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robust adoption of technologies such as the ZLD in the power generation sector.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing application of ZLD in desalination.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage of ZLD technology in recovering of valuable Minerals compounds.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several water treatment facilities across the globe have started using zero liquid discharge (ZLD) technology for purifying wastewater.This new-age technology is capable of recycling and decontaminating wastewater without letting a single drop of water go to waste at the end of the treatment cycle.Enforcement of stringent laws on waste water management is expected to further drive the adoption of ZLD technology in the near future.Per the latest Persistence Market Research (PMR) report, sales revenue from ZLD projects worldwide is expected to reach $513.9 Million by 2017-end.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PMR in its outlook, titled 'Zero Liquid Discharge Market: Global Industry Analysis and Forecast, 2017-2025' projects that the ZLD market in APAC will maintain its top position throughout the assessment period.Towards the closing end of the forecast period, the region’s ZLD market estimate to reach a valuation of $434.4 Million, expanding at 10.8% CAGR.Meanwhile, adoption of ZLD in Latin America will remain robust, despite having a significantly smaller market size as compared to other key regions.In North America, power generation plants are major implementers of ZLD, supporting the growth of the ZLD market in the region over the recent past.The North America ZLD market is estimated to reach $243.9 Million by the end of the forecast period, creating an incremental opportunity of $109.8 Million between 2017 2025.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key insights compiled in the report reveal that the new water management laws introduced in India, China and Mexico is further expanding applications of ZLD technologies in these countries.Nonetheless, the high cost of setup and maintenance continue to be a major drawback of the technologies.Moreover, the arrival of alternative water treatment techniques is likely to hamper the growth of the market.Which is why manufacturers are actively focusing on further innovations in ZLD to reduce technological complications while its implementation.Veolia Water Technologies, Doosan Hydro Technology, Suez Environnement, GE Water Process Technologies, Aquatech International LLC, GEA Group, Aquarion AG, IDE Technologies, Alfa Laval Corporate AB, Thermax Global, ENCON Evaporators, U.S. Water Services, 3V Green Eagle S.p.A. are some of the leading companies operating in the global market for zero liquid discharge.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Highlight from the Report Include:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of system type, demand for hybrid ZLD technology will continue to gain traction is the forthcoming years.By 2017-end, hybrid ZLD technology is expected to account for a value share of 64.0%.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PMR report identifies that application of zero liquid discharge in power generation is expected to remain high throughout the forecast period.In the power generation industry, ZLD technology primarily finds its applications in treating power plant effluent discharges from cooling tower blow downs and scrubbers, and IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) wastewater / gray water treatment.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know More About Report</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising demand for lubricants and paints dyes are creating new opportunities for the steel salvage drums manufacturers across the globe.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising raw material cost of steel are expect to hamper the market for steel salvage drums during the forecast period 2018-2028.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China and India in Asia Pacific region are expected to witness noteworthy growth for steel salvage drums market.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, industrial packaging have seen significant rise in demand due to technological advancement in industrial applications like petroleum, chemicals, etc.One such type of industrial packaging can be done by steel salvage drums.Steel salvage drums are designed for storing hazardous substances or products that can be leaked, or damaged while transit.According to U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), steel salvage drums are high quality drums which are sturdy and tough while handling and shipping.Furthermore, steel salvage drums perform surprisingly well in a broad range of temperatures, humidity, and pressure.Steel salvage drums can be found with several head types like tight head and open head.Tight head steel salvage drums are used for storing low viscous fluids and open head drums for hazardous solid and liquids.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steel salvage drums manufacturers are looking for cost effective packaging solutions for overcoming the challenges related to bulk packaging.Hence, many industrial packaging manufacturers are focusing on creating innovative packaging solutions like steel salvage drums to satisfy up-coming demands from end use industries.Industries are nowadays preferring steel salvage drums above its counterparts owing to their high mechanical strength, and when effectively emptied steel salvage drums can be reused many times.In addition, steel salvage drums remain the perfect storage option as they can provide better sanitation that plastic drums cannot, and are considerably eco-friendly.Furthermore, rising demand for lubricants and paints dyes are creating new opportunities for the steel salvage drums manufacturers across the globe.Rising raw material cost of steel are expect to hamper the market for steel salvage drums during the forecast period 2018-2028.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global steel salvage drums market is segmented by product type, closure type, capacity, head type, and end use industry.The pricing for steel salvage drums
