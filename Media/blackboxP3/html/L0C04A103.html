members found that increases in U.S. domestic and international tax rates would have a negative effect on business expansion, hiring and wage growth, investments in research and development (R) and innovation, and U.S. competitiveness in the global economy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the survey results, 98 percent of CEOs said that an increase in the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent would have a 'moderately' to 'very' significant adverse effect on their company’s competitiveness.Seventy-five percent of CEOs said that an increased tax burden on U.S. companies would negatively affect their company’s investments in R and innovation, 71 percent said it would negatively affect their ability to hire, and nearly two-thirds said it would result in slower wage growth for U.S. workers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An overwhelming majority—88 percent—of respondents agreed that maintaining globally competitive U.S. tax policies is important for business expansion.When asked about an increase in the GILTI rate from 10.5 percent to 21 percent, 76 percent of CEOs reported it would have a 'moderately' to 'very' significant impact on their company’s competitiveness, including plans for U.S. capital spending and hiring.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-13T13:31:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
