an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 when compared to non-pregnant people.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you need to know</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the overall risk of severe illness is low, pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 when compared to non-pregnant people</p><p><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</sup><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having certain underlying medical conditions, and other factors, such as age or occupation, can further increase a pregnant person’s risk for developing severe illness.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnant people with COVID-19 might also be at increased risk for other poor outcomes, such as preterm birth (delivering the baby earlier than 37 weeks).</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnant people and people who live with or visit them need to take steps to protect themselves from getting sick with COVID-19.</li></p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased Risk of Severe Illness</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe illness means that a person with COVID-19 may require:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hospitalization,</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intensive care,</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a ventilator or special equipment to help them breathe</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People with COVID-19 who become severely ill may even die.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain Factors Can Increase Risk</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other factors can further increase a pregnant person’s risk for experiencing severe illness from COVID-19, such as having certain underlying medical conditions or being older than a certain age</p><p><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.People with an underlying medical condition should continue to follow the treatment plan prescribed by their healthcare provider.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions in the places where pregnant people live, learn, work, play, and worship also affect health risks and outcomes, such as getting sick with COVID-19 or developing severe illness.For example, people who are pregnant and work in places where they cannot keep their distance from people who may be sick, like healthcare providers, are at increased risk for getting sick and developing severe illness from COVID-19.Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put pregnant people from some racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting sick from COVID-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding additional factors that can put pregnant people at an increased risk can help them make decisions about what kind of precautions to take to protect themselves from infection.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effect on Pregnancy Outcomes</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnant people with COVID-19 might be at increased risk for other poor outcomes related to pregnancy, such as preterm birth (delivering the baby earlier than 37 weeks)</p><p><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the latest data on birth and infant outcomes among pregnant women with

your own personal situation and the risk for you, your family, and your community when deciding whether or not to go out or interact with people who do not live with you.Ensure you and the people who live with you are taking steps to protect themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best ways to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 is to:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limit in-person interactions with people who might have been exposed to or who might be infected with COVID-19, including people within your household, as much as possible.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take steps to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear a mask.Avoid others who are not wearing
