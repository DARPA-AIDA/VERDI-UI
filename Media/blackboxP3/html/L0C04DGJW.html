convert members of the LGBT+ community to a heterosexual orientation and has been widely discredited by scientific studies.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further research has found that conversion therapy can lead to depression, suicidal thoughts, and other mental health issues.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia became the first southern state and 20th state overall to ban conversion

of progress in the movement for LGBT+ rights but most people would also agree that there is a long way to go.Even though progress has been seen on the front regarding gay marriage, members of this community still face discrimination on a daily basis, as there are still plenty of people who believe that individuals of this community are somehow 'less than' those who are not.One of the ways in which individuals in this community might be discriminated against is through something called conversion therapy.The vast majority of people agree that this is something that should be banned.Is it on the way to being banned?</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been numerous statements that have been released in opposition to conversion therapy and there are countless individuals who are fighting to remove it completely.Sadly, conversion therapy is still an option in many parts of the country.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who might not know, conversion therapy is something that is intended to 'convert' individuals to a heterosexual orientation.This therapy has been around for a long time and while it often has a religious slant to it, this is not always the case.This type of conversion therapy can take many shapes and forms.Sometimes it involves deliberate exposure to heterosexual activities and other times it might involve continuous prayer.In other cases, it might even involve physical pain.There have been numerous statements that have been released in opposition to conversion therapy and there are countless individuals who are fighting to remove it completely.Sadly, conversion therapy is still an option in many parts of the country.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many states that have put laws into effect to ban conversion therapy.So far, the total number is 20.Therefore, 40 percent of the country has banned conversion therapy.One notable name that was added to this list is Virginia, which became the first state in the south to completely ban conversion therapy.While North Carolina has banned the use of taxpayer dollars, NC did not completely ban conversion therapy.In banning conversion therapy, the VA state governor released a statement indicating that conversion therapy simply sends a harmful message that there is something wrong with individuals who are members of the LGBT+ community.Other states such as NY may ban it as well.Of course, conversion therapy is incredibly discriminatory and the governor also indicated that conversion therapy has been widely discredited in studies.Of course, it should come as no surprise that conversion therapy can also lead to numerous mental health issues down the road including depression and suicide.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A report that was published by the UCLA school of law found that close to 700,000 adults who are members of the LGBT+ community had gone through conversion therapy at some point in their lives.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that numerous individuals have been put through conversion therapy and have voiced their concerns about the pain and anguish they went through during this time.A report that was published by the UCLA school of law found that close to 700,000 adults who are members of the LGBT+ community had gone through conversion therapy at some point in their lives.For most of these individuals, this treatment took place during their adolescent years.The report also concluded that conversion therapy led to an increase in the rate of suicidal thoughts, depression, and drug abuse among adolescents.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, there is something that has to be done to address the problem of conversion therapy.It is nice to see that many states have already taken steps to eliminate this practice in their states.The reality is that something has to be done to ban conversion therapy throughout the entire country.LGBT+ rights need to be protected and nobody in this community should ever be made to feel like something is wrong with their sexual orientation.Nobody would ever choose to face this type of discrimination.It will be interesting to see if more steps are taken to ban conversion therapy in other parts of the country.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
