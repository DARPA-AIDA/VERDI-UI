hearing impairment and severe gastric upsets.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://nypost.com/2021/06/09/doctor...covid-variant/</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So will we need a mask to protect

ones who never took it seriously from the beginning won't bother to receive new information.And those of us who did everything we could to protect ourselves and others are still taking precautions.But, overall, people are going to tend to disregard this until it gets really bad again.We've seen it already.Humans are selfish and do not like to be 'inconvenienced.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pragmatism is underutilized, even in a pandemic where it would be most helpful.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

'standard rule' of more infectious but less deadly.While significant, and of concern, neither have been overwhelming.The first one I began tracking was E484x (the x means there are a few different letters that could go here), and the second was L452x Each of these gave us variants that were both rapid spreading and somewhat resistant to antibodies we were using to fight them, giving rise to concerns that we would need to create a second vaccine, or that they might cause another surge.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they (and others) produced an uptick, the increase was minimal, and we are once again on our way to herd immunity.For the US, the pandemic is essentially over.While the virus will be with us forever, the number of infections will remain small.</p><p><tbody>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless there is a completely different variant, which would make it 'Covid-22' or something, there will be no more surges.This doesn't mean we are 'safe' from the virus, but it does mean we are in no greater danger from it, than from other hazards of life.</tbody><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-06-11T12:48:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
