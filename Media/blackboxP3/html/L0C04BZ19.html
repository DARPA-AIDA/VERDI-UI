try and have an argument against masks.Masks don't help the wearer, they're for the people around the wearer.It's to prevent other people from potentially getting covid from you.While this seems annoying and like you shouldn't have to wear one if you know you don't have covid: almost 40% of people with covid don't present symptoms.You could simply just not know.Also, if you don't have covid, good on you, but what about other people who do?It is easier to commit to an action as a whole, and simply protect everyone than to get involved in some round-about process to avoid just wearing a simple piece of cloth.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-20T13:27:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Patrick Danvik</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do your own research.The masks havent worked from the beginning.The virus is actually small enough to go through the mask.Wearing nothing is safer than the mask.it allows you to breath with taking in less oxygen putting more strain on the body.This makes the body more susceptible to a weakened immune system.Take some vitamin d and go work out.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-18T10:16:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>jay</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If masks don't work, the lockdowns don't work, and there's no vaccine, we might have to rely on the immune system that's been in place for the entirety of human existence.That system is 99+% effective across the whole population.For the highest at risk group (75+yrs old) the survival rate is about 95%.The vaccines they tested on healthy younger volunteers are 90-94% effective with nasty side effects they've only begun to start cataloguing.Your choice, but I say eat good food, exercise a little bit, and enjoy whatever life is your to live.Death comes for us all some day.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

</i></strong>TMSJapan</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're absolutely right.So long as humans live in social communities, all parasitic life forms that depend on humans to survive, will find a path to infect them.The only known factor regarding viral transmission is the fact that it is the quantity of virus exposure (viral load) that has a direct relationship to the severity of the illness.A light exposure typically results in little to no symptoms while heavier exposure increases the likelihood of more severe illness.So avoidance of heavy exposure is the only proactive strategy.It is unreasonable to expect to control exposure but reasonable to control the amount of exposure.Masks are not the answer, but they do signal to everyone that the environment is ripe with virus and we need to limit our exposure to mitigate the risk.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-18T22:55:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Stephen

for yourself.Just working on things like Vit D, C, melatonin, better diet, losing weight, good sleep, exercise, being in nature- all attainable, a lot of it free.Doing these things alleviates much fear and gives you control over the situation.Also, if you look at all cause mortality stats in U.S. to give you perspective you will find that about 2.3.million people die in the U.S. each year.This averages out to around 230,000 people each month (stats from CDC).Cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc (all comorbidities for Covid-19) are listed..The total number of Covid-19 now?275,00 deaths in 9 months?How many would have occurred normally?What can you work on now for your immunity?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-18T11:03:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

continued to die in drives.Accordingly, General Gorgas issued his opinion regarding masks as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'While the donning of face coverings during this influenza crisis may appeal to many, its benefits in reducing the spread of infection is dubious.The only benefit realized, is that it reduces the number of men who chew tobacco, from spitting on the streets.Beyond that, the only other benefit realized, is that it makes our citizens constantly aware of the crisis at hand.'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-18T13:08:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

propaganda weaponized against the public.It is a great test in controlling huge populations and is being fined tuned for future use.It is destroying many people and especially families who are suffering from unemployment resulting in loss of income which then results in hunger, home eviction and ultimately depression and possibly domestic violence.I put all blame on the politicians who are using this 'pandemic' into scaring and thereby controlling the population into submission with not only the 'disease' but fines and arrests.I have not worn a mask 3 times in my grocery shopping and was first told they would enforce me wearing a mask and second no one,not anyone looked at me sideways.I have felt free again.I urge people to question this 'pandemic' and take back their freedom.BTW,

years old..Why?Because he waited tell he was so sick he had to be transported by ambulance to the hospital.He survived for 3 more weeks.Pneumonia set in and that is what he died of.Just as one might with a more common flu or cold.https://wattsupwiththat.com/2020/11/17/where-are-all-the-sick-people/?unapproved=3128317=03bd68761d8e2af30f63d977db002bb2#comment-3128317</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

people sheep and lemmings sadly many are following.Businesses that force mask wearing I do not go too, These businesses would get more business if they posted signs that read they are not responsible if you get Covid19 entering their store mask-less.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Race Trac gas stations, my bank and other businesses have this posted outside and they are thriving while others are not.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no medical mask to date from my research that will prevent air born virus except perhaps a full hazmat uniform with oxygen tank.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

adding to the problem.Is that implausible?After all, people have been wearing them (a whole lot of people, even during riots) and the number of cases have skyrocketed.So, maybe masks are only exacerbating the problem.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-19T11:23:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Susan</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very well could be.I have
