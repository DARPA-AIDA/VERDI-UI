Company introduced new product NIKA-Siri X-12 ropes for application of mooring, ship to ship (STS) operation in 2017.NIKA-Siri X-12 are high module UHMWPE 12 strand ropes, which are cost effective and over-braided ropes.It aids in decreasing mooring towing operating times and also lowers labor requirement in various operations.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asia Pacific is projected to be the fastest growing region in the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene ropes market over the forecast period.Rapid growth in aviation industry is expected to drive growth of the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene market in emerging economies such as India and China.For instance, according to India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), India has become the world’s fastest growing domestic travel market recording a 26.6% year-on-year growth in January 2017, which has bolstered demand for aviation industry goods, which includes UHMWPE ropes.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key Players</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major players operating in the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene rope market include Liros Gmbh, Dyneema, Thanawala Co, Cousin Trestec, Atlantic Braids Ltd, New England Ropes, Miami Cordage, Lankhorst, Katradis, Samson, Bridon, Ropesling, Southern Ropes, and others.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key players are strategically investing in research and development, in order to enhance their product portfolio.Furthermore, players are focusing on inorganic strategies For instance, WireCo World Group Inc., a company focused on producing and marketing of rope and cable, acquired Royal Lankhorst Euronete Group, to develop synthetic rope in 2012.Furthermore, Samson and The Manitowoc Company jointly launched Manitowoc’s Grove RT770E rough-terrain mobile crane, which features the first fully synthetic hoist rope designed specifically for mobile cranes, in March 2014.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2019-04-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Aman Jain</p></p><p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y3.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04EYDP.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495XV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495XW.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495YA.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495XU.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y8.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495YI.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495Y0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495YE.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495Y7.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2019-04-10</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-07-10</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04EYCU</p></body></html>
