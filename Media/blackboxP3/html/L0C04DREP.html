Instruments Tuned Into Genre of Astronomy</h1><p>When Musical Instruments Tuned Into Genre of Astronomy</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music plays a crucial role in our life and it is essential for all composers to have a good influence on society, which could result in having a healthy mind.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instruments which used in the album make you feel fear and this feeling get you think about the universe and existence.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'By using big monitors together with the produced astronomical music, we are going to introduce astronomical facts to the audience.'</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to say that from the beginning of human creation, there were music, the sound of birds, the sound of water, the sound of wind when it blows through the trees, the sound of rain and all those inspired people who repeated the sounds of nature as a language to refine their souls.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music has changed our minds and our imagination, and it has become a reason for the development of science music, therefore we can define a composer, as an author of music, because the composer, who is fully surrounded by the science of music, would be able to write his ideas in the alphabet of music.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this attitude, the BijanNorouz Worldwide Music has moved forward into the realm of science music, by trying to introduce astronomical phenomena via using the seven musical letters.By producing musical works in the fields of Film, Science Documentaries, Astronomy, the Universe, Physics and Quantum, BijanNorouz’s team have been working passionately to combine music and science together.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BijanNorouz, has studied simultaneously in the fields of Physics, sound engineering and music.He believes that this sort of music can change our life.It can help us to think and produce new ideas for this modern word.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to BijanNorouz, music plays a crucial role in our life and it is essential for all composers to have a good influence on society, which could result in having a healthy mind.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music and Science</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Music is a universal language,' BijanNorouz said.'There are other musicians in the world who work in the field of producing astronomical music, although there is not such a purposeful activity to produce astronomical albums every year.We consider defined targets in our project, in a way to provide specialized topics in the genre of music every year.Therefore, we can change our musical platform based on the defined topics.We are trying to consider music as a technology and science.'</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music is A Culture</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BijanNorouz explained about the production of astronomical films and translating scientific books in the field of artificial intelligence along with music related to artificial intelligence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added that along with being a music band, we have a technical and engineering research group, and some other friends, who have led us to cooperate with space centers in other countries.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By producing musical works in the fields of Film, Science Documentaries, Astronomy, the Universe, Physics and Quantum, BijanNorouz’s team have been working passionately to combine music and science together.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperation with Universal Space Centers</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Content production has been a part of activities of all Space Centers around the world' he said.'By content production, I mean producing Multimedia, Film and Documentary, which music is considered as their essential part.Our duty is to cooperate with those space centers, who need music for content production, by producing music with the highest standards.</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to start some activities in the field of cinematic astronomical documentaries in the country.Based on our programming, we decided to plan related events once every 3 months in which we are going to play astronomical documentaries with Dolby surround sound and music.'</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these astronomical events, we are trying to introduce technologies related to astronomy rather than just talking about new celestial events.Our main concern would be introducing new space technologies, such as new satellites, solar batteries, and scientific topics in general.'</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious Astronomical Music Albums</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early 2018, the group put out their first album named G.R.A.V.I.T.Y. which is in DVD format.Now it is available on Audio CD version in the market, while all our products come along with astronomical video clips.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group has produced some music for the planetarium and as he mentioned, they need videos to make astronomical documentaries, these videos are both made by the team or by the space agency.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BijanNorouz had studied Physics, Audio Engineering and Music at the same time, therefore he knows many international researchers around the world.He produces music with the approach of science for them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instruments and Fear</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instruments which used in the album make you feel fear and this feeling get you think about the universe and existence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BijanNorouz believes that being aware of the concept of worldview, is an essential fact in science.'The field of composing is a scientific and complex one, so composers must have a worldview in order to comprehend any phenomena.In this way a magnificent work could be produced and could have an impact on society which results in having a healthy mind.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he mentioned the single tracks of the album are available to download on the website,however people abroad have downloaded them more than Iranian people.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding an Astronomical Concert</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointing out the importance of the group’s basic knowledge achievements, BijanNorouz explained: 'Supposed that we are going to show the country’s spatial scientific achievements in an exhibition.It is more influential if we exhibit them using the highest quality documentary films.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He announced about holding an astronomical concert in the near future and said: 'By using big monitors together with the produced astronomical music, we are going to introduce astronomical facts to the audience.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AT THE END THINKING IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THIS MUSIC COMPANY</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space
