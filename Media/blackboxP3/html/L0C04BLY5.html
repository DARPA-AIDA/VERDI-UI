Bush in 2008, is intended to protect the Great Lakes from what its authors called 'overspending.'The agreement came in response to several proposals at the turn of the 21st century from international companies to ship Great Lakes water out of the basin in tankers and in bottles.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the compact, the eight Great Lakes states and two Canadian provinces agreed to adopt water conservation plans and to abide by strict rules for allowing and managing diversions of Great Lakes water.The compact recognizes the lakes as a shared resource, which no single state owns, but of which all states are stewards.A defining feature of the compact is its emphasis on using regional cooperation to manage the lakes as a single ecosystem.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement’s primary provisions are aimed at minimizing the amount of Great Lakes water that is unnaturally diverted out of the Great Lakes basin, never to return to the lakes.There are limited exceptions for communities, like Waukesha, that straddle the basin boundary and may be allowed to divert water for public use if they 1) return unconsumed water to the basin after use, 2) show that the need for the diversion cannot be avoided through conservation and efficient use of existing water supplies, and 3) show that the diversion will not hurt water quality or quantity.Such diversions require the approval of all eight Great Lakes governors.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case For Diversion</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waukesha is busy making its case for such a diversion.The city’s water supply relies mainly on wells which draw from aquifers deep underground.Over the past century, the level of the deep aquifer water table has dropped by about 500 feet and continues to drop at a rate of 5 feet to 9 feet annually.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only has the groundwater been depleted, it has become more and more affected by pollutants like salt and radium, which have dramatically increased in concentration.The city is under legal obligation to fall into compliance with federal radium standards by the year 2018.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waukesha draws its water from deep wells that are becoming contaminated with salt and radium.Click image to enlarge.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the city’s alternative water supplies are exactly ideal.While the use of shallow surface aquifers has been discussed, there are 4,000 acres of wetlands near the proposed shallow drilling area that may be harmed.Drawing from the Fox River also poses environmental issues.The method involves sucking water through the soil just adjacent to the river.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city asserts that its best option is to purchase an annual average of 10.1 million gallons per day from Oak Creek, which lies within the Great Lakes basin and ultimately obtains its supply from Lake Michigan.That is 3.15 million gallons per day more than it currently uses.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the documents justifying the diversion the city asserts that its population will grow to 97,400 by 2050, and it also needs to make provisions for supplying water to new industries.But water use by industrial companies, which reached 4.1 million gallons per day in 1980, has dropped to 900,000 gallons daily, a nearly 80 percent reduction, according to city reports.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waukesha residents support the city’s application, which is being reviewed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.'Our new mayor was elected on a platform that included obtaining Great Lakes water for the water supply.He won receiving 62 percent of the vote,' says Duchniak.'Opposition to the water sale has primarily come from outside of the City.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Olson, a lawyer specializing in water law and founder of FLOW, a Great Lakes law and policy center in Traverse City, MI, is among the critics.'The reason for the exception for straddling communities was to meet their fundamental needs, not as an artifice to expand and grow other communities outside the basin,' Olson says.'The Great Lakes by Supreme Court law are held by the states, and under the compact, as a public trust for public trust purposes like boating, swimming, navigation, fishing and health or sustenance of those who live in the basin.This means the water can’t be transferred outside the basin as if it was a commodity for non-public trust purposes.'</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaye LaFond, a recent graduate of Michigan Tech, is
