'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question that always remains is this: -</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do any nations in the whole wide world actually KNOW HOW to help, to resolve a situation that has remained one of the most toxic and violent in modern history?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some serious thinking outside the confines of a very old and much battered box is required here.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any hope of ever putting certain matters right, both regionally and even globally, depends on concerted action being taken by the sum of humanity and not left to the earnest but often miscued attentions of Uncle Sam.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;www.laxiankey.com -- ' If WE would will the end, then WE must also will the means.
