Iraq, on Sunday, leaving at least one person injured.A security source told the AFP news agency on Sunday that one rocket hit an embassy cafeteria during dinner time, while two other rockets landed nearby.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Zone was the most common name for the International Zone of Baghdad.Its official name beginning under the Iraqi Interim Government was the International Zone, though Green Zone remains the most commonly used term.</figcaption><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y8.png' style='max-width:

​​the Iraqi capital.According to Al Arabiya, Iraqi security forces issued a statement stating that five rockets hit the Green Zone on Sunday, but did not mention anything to do with the U.S. embassy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a statement broadcast on state television, Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi, in his first comments on the attacks on the Green Zone, said that 'the continued irresponsible, unilateral behavior harms the higher interests of the country and its relations with its friends.'He added that Baghdad was committed to protecting all the diplomatic missions in Iraq, and was taking all necessary measures to achieve that.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demonstrations</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muqtada al-Sadr is an Iraqi Shia cleric, politician and militia leader.He is the leader of the Sadrist Movement and the leader of Saraya al-Salam, a Shia militia that is a reformation of the previous militia he led during the American occupation of Iraq, the Mahdi Army.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, thousands of protesters took to the streets in Baghdad to call for American troops to leave Iraq.The protest, which brought together supporters of cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, took place weeks after the American attack that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in the Iraqi capital.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of Americans in the country has become more contested since the incident, which raised fears of a possible war between the United States and Iran.Days before the attack that killed Soleimani, dozens of Iraqi Shiite militiamen and their supporters had invaded the United States embassy complex in Baghdad.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump, Salih Conversation</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Wednesday, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, met with the Iraqi head of state, Barham Salih, in Davos, Switzerland, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.They talked about the future of the American mission in the country.According to Salih, there will be a reduction in the number of American troops.Currently, about 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq.Americans were invited in 2014 by the Baghdad government to help fight Islamic State.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Soleimani’s death, Iraq’s parliament converged and approved the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq.Trump then threatened to impose economic sanctions on the country, but on Wednesday he adopted a more conciliatory tone.He said the number of troops in the country today is much lower than at the time of the occupation, between 2003 and 2011.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘We’re down to 5,000.So we’re down to a very low number, historically low, and we’ll see what happens,' said Trump.When asked about sanctions, he remained non-committal and replied: 'We’ll see what happens.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of

the disease.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China rose to 81 on Monday.The Chinese government, in a bid to contain the spread of the virus, has extended the national Lunar New Year holiday by three days, to Sunday.Also, large Chinese companies have closed, albeit temporarily.Some have instructed their employees to work from home in an attempt to contain the virus.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coronaviruses are species of virus belonging to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae, in the order Nidovirales.There are seven known strains of human coronaviruses, including Wuhan Coronavirus.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese Premier Li Keqiang recently visited the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, in a move by the government to show solidarity with the affected persons, and also to express its commitment, in as far as responding to the outbreak is concerned.The total number of confirmed cases in China has increased by about 30% to about 3000, with about half of the reported cases in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan.However, some experts suspect that the number of people infected is much higher than the figures being relayed by the government.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese government extended the Lunar New Year holiday by three days, until February 2, in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.The Lunar New Year is usually a time for travel for millions of Chinese people, but many have had to cancel their travel plans due to the disease outbreak.As the concern grows worldwide, Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region of China, which has had eight confirmed cases, has banned people who have visited Hubei in the past fourteen days.The ban does not cover Hong Kong residents, however.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2019 novel coronavirus, also known as 2019-nCoV, is the virus causing the 2019–20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.The first suspected cases were officially reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macau, another Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, which has had at least one case of the virus, has imposed a ban similar to those arriving from Hubei, unless they can prove they are virus-free.In Shanghai, many companies and factories have closed their doors and are temporarily stopped at the direction of the local government.The stoppage period is set to last until at least February 10.The ban applies to all companies apart from utilities, medical firms, medical suppliers, and supermarkets.The city of Haikou, on the island of Hainan in southern China, has quarantined tourists for fourteen days.'Hubei people are getting discriminated against,' complained a Wuhan resident on the Weibo social media platform.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a small number of cases linked to people who traveled from Wuhan have been confirmed in more than ten countries— including Thailand, France, Japan, and the United States— no deaths have been reported elsewhere.Asian stocks fell, with Japan’s Nikkei index dropping 2.0%, its biggest drop in one day in five months, as investors became increasingly concerned.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection, and so far, health experts haven’t devised a specific cure or vaccine for the disease.Most of the people who have so far been killed by the disease are the elderly and those with pre-existing ailments related to the respiratory system.The director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is meanwhile in Beijing to discuss ways of eradicating the outbreak with the Chinese government and health experts.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
