is not enough.You need to develop healthy dental hygiene habits and use the right oral care products.Here are seven tips to help you.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Floss Regularly</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a toothbrush is vital for maintaining good oral health, it cannot remove the food particles in between your teeth.That is why flossing is one of the most significant dental hygiene habits.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing your teeth twice a day is immensely important.</figcaption><p><img

dentists claim that flossing benefits your oral health in multiple ways.It can help remove plaque, as well as reduce the risk of tooth decay, gingivitis, and gum disease.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, flossing can be difficult and tiresome but it does not mean you should give up.Look for tools, such as interdental brushes, which will facilitate the process and make it more pleasant.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Brushing Teeth Twice Daily</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing your teeth twice a day is immensely important.Here are a few tips on how to properly brush your teeth:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aim the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle towards the gum line.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a pea-sized amount of toothpaste.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus on the gum line as plaque always migrates towards this area.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brush your teeth gently in a circular motion.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Choose a Toothbrush with Soft Bristles</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your toothbrush should have soft bristles.Hard bristles can result in receding gums and damaged enamel.That way, the roots of your teeth get exposed and become more sensitive to heat and cold.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A toothbrush should also have a small head size.It should easily fit into the mouth and brush one tooth at a time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.Use a Fluoride Toothpaste</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When choosing toothpaste, we often make a mistake focusing on flavors and whitening power.The most significant element of your toothpaste is fluoride.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This substance is critical to the defense against tooth decay.It creates a protective barrier for your teeth and strengthens them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.Visit your Dentist Regularly</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule regular dental checkups and cleanings.Your dentist will monitor your oral health and determine whether your teeth may need fillings.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, a dentist will provide you with actionable tips on the best oral hygiene tools and practices.That is why you should always choose a dentist you trust.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case of a toothache, do not delay a dental checkup.Tooth infections can spread fast to other areas, such as your jaw bone, face, throat, and even head.If you have the following symptoms, you should call your emergency dentist immediately:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toothache that lasts longer than a day</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain when biting or chewing</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fever</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swelling</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red gums</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficulty swallowing</li></p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bristles start to lose stiffness, they will lose effectiveness.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.Change your Toothbrush Regularly</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bristles in your toothbrush are straight and soft, they are easier to navigate the small spaces in your mouth.They can eliminate food and bacteria.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when the bristles start to lose stiffness, they will lose effectiveness.That is when you should replace your old toothbrush immediately.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use electric toothbrush heads, replace them every 12 weeks.Their bristles are shorter, meaning they often wear faster.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from lower effectiveness, old toothbrushes can also cause viral and bacterial infections.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.Try to Quit Smoking</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking exposes your teeth to harmful nicotine.Consequently, it results in stained, yellow teeth and bad breath.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, while there are many remedies you can use to whiten your teeth or combat bad breath, you should not neglect more the severe effects of smoking on your oral health.For example, smoking lowers your immune system can cause oral cancer.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking also causes gum (periodontal) disease, an infection that affects your gum line.It occurs when tartar and bacteria grow below or above your gums and cause inflammation.Smoking is directly linked with gum disease.Nicotine reduces saliva production, enabling tartar and bacteria to accumulate in your mouth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you believe that e-cigarettes are healthier for your health, you are wrong.While they do not produce smoke, they still contain nicotine.Additionally, the vapor also contains a wide range of chemicals and heavy metals that are bad for both your oral and general health.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining a Good Oral Hygiene Is Essential</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without proper oral hygiene, bacteria can accumulate in your mouth and cause tooth decay, gum disease, and multiple oral infections.That is why you should maintain your dental health regularly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While that is not a definitive list of all oral hygiene tips, it will serve as a solid starting point.For additional tips and insights, consult your dentist.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
