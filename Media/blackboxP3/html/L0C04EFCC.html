(EEU) Monday and voted in favor of joining the union as an 'observer state.'The Senate of the Oliy Majlis of Uzbekistan held its fourth plenary session by video conference.The senators attended remotely, from studios in the capital, Tashkent, Nukus, and other regions.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) is an economic union of states located in central and northern Asia and Eastern Europe.The Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union was signed on 29 May 2014 by the leaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia, and came into force on 1 January 2015.</figcaption><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495YI.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported that 20 issues, including 10 laws, were included in the agenda of the plenary session.Of Uzbekistan’s 100 senators, 91 took part in the voting.Of these, 71 voted in favor of joining the EEU as observers.Sixteen senators opposed the Senate resolution, while four senators abstained.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower house of the Uzbek Parliament considered the country’s cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union on April 28.The Legislative Chamber approved its accession as an observer.At that time, 86 deputies voted in favor of the resolution, 32 opposed it, and 14 abstained.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of Uzbekistan’s accession to the EEC is one of the most hotly debated political issues in recent years.Many bloggers and activists believe that this is one of the most important decisions in the modern history of Uzbekistan.In fact, April 28, 2020, will remain an ominous day in the history of Uzbekistan, they say.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Name of the Black Union</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many observers and analysts see the Eurasian Economic Union as a reflection of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s efforts to rebuild the former Soviet Union.However, the other side— especially Russian politicians— insists that there is no political purpose in the union.They say it is organized only to increase economic cooperation between the post-Soviet states.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia— former members of the former Soviet Union— are members of the Eurasian Economic Union.Moldova has the status of an observer state.The only customs control is established in the territory of the member states of the Union.In addition, citizens of member states are not required to obtain a work permit in the country where they work as migrant workers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction to the Union</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the idea of ​​an economic union in the post-Soviet space was put forward in 1994 by former Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev.At the time, Mr.Nazarbayev was adamant that five of the post-Soviet states— Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan— were permanent members of the union.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nazarbayev also said that Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and even the autonomous republics of Georgia— South Ossetia, and Abkhazia— could later become full members of the Union.At the same time, Russia’s warm relations with the West, huge economic difficulties, and the late Boris Yeltsin’s reluctance to deal with the Commonwealth of Independent States prevented Nazarbayev’s proposal from becoming a reality.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putin, who became prime minister in 2011, had raised the issue ahead of the 2012 presidential election.Based on the experience of the Customs Union, established in 2010 between the Eurasian Economic Community, Putin predicted unprecedented economic growth in the future.As early as those years, western political analysts warned that Putin’s initiative was a political move to strengthen Russia’s control over the former Soviet republics.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear of Losing Independence</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shavkat Miromonovich Mirziyoyev is an Uzbek politician who has served as President of Uzbekistan and Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Uzbekistan since 2016.Previously he was the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan from 2003 to 2016.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News of Uzbekistan’s possible accession to the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) caused a stir in the autumn of 2019, sparking widespread protests.Despite the protests, the Uzbek government approved the Eurasian Economic Union’s observer status in March, and sent a proposal to parliament.Earlier, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said that the benefits of joining the Eurasian bloc for Uzbekistan were being studied.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February, Prime Minister Abdullah Aripov said that if Uzbekistan will become a member of the union, more than two million Uzbeks working in Russia will be relieved of their patent burdens and the issue should be considered by parliament.However, there are deputies and senators in the country who support the decision.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to them, Uzbekistan’s economic development is currently inextricably linked to Russia, and at a time when the national economy is experiencing difficult times due to quarantine restrictions, it is 'impossible to fly with the most powerful state in the region.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proponents of the parliament say that being an 'observer state' is the safest way for Uzbekistan to become politically secure today.Now the Senate resolution will be presented to the President.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
