nobody else can speak for you.'</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2016, I joined the UMGC Power Speakers.The UMGC Power Speakersserves as the University of Maryland Global Campus’ chapter of Toastmasters International, a world leader in communication and leadership development.The club provides an encouraging setting for those who want to develop their public speaking skills and gain the confidence to become more effective communicators.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since joining, I have learned how to share my story with ease.For this reason, I ask:</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s your story?Are you confidently prepared to tell it?</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing your story and having the poise to tell it breeds success and satisfaction in life.If you want to learn how to tell your story to engage the hearts, heads, and hands of your audience, I encourage you to join Toastmasters International.If you are a student, a staff member, or an alumnus of UMGC, I invite you to join the UMGC Power Speakers.Whether you want to give a notable toast, nail a presentation, prosper during a job interview, perform onstage, or simply blaze a new trail, the UMGC Power Speakers Toastmasters group is here to support your communication and leadership goals.Our club meets via ZOOM twice a month the first and third Tuesday of the month.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would like to stay updated about our club’s future meetings contact us.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-10-26T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Tanya Ward Jordan</p></p><p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y3.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C04EXJQ.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C04EXJG.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495XV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495XW.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495YA.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495XU.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y8.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495YI.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495Y0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y2.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495YE.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495Y7.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-10-26</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-07-09</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04EXJ9</p></body></html>
