difference in your job search.It’s easy to skim another article thinking it will make the difference, but without action, it’s just information.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is actively hiring?Has a company just laid off a lot of workers?They probably aren’t the ones to apply for.Seek out those businesses that are still actively moving forward.Not everybody shut down during the pandemic, even if it felt like they did.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Network with those in your industry.Put the word out you’re looking for work.Join industry related groups on LinkedIn or check with professional organizations to see what resources they have.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider temporary opportunities to hold you over, such as contract and remote work.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you have a quiet, organized space for virtual interviews, such as those that take place on conference software like Zoom.Present yourself in the best light.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a way to elevate your skills or development within your industry?Take the time to improve your abilities.It’s a great way to not only build your confidence, but also offer more value to the companies you’re applying to.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tackle stress or anxiety before taking interviews.It’s important to sound confident, not desperate.Think of ways that you can do this, whether it’s something as simple as going for a run or walk, deep breathing, doing some kind of prep work, or focusing on positive outcomes.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set Google alerts and alerts on job searching sites for keywords in your industry.This way you’ll hear about new opportunities quickly.Not every job site will have this helpful resource but be sure to check the big sites.Also, with Google alerts it’s a great way to stay current in your industry for news as well and talking points.</li></p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there positions you may not have thought of for employment which may actually be a fit for your skills?Are you open to new opportunities you hadn’t considered?</figcaption><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak with job recruiters.They may know of opportunities you don’t.Open doors you may not have thought of in the past.There are a lot of overlooked avenues which allow you to find information you may not have access to.Most companies don’t post their jobs to boards, and recruiters may have an in with certain businesses, hiring managers, and know if there’s talk of hiring timelines.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create strong habits of seeking out work and applying for it on a regular basis, so it’s not a random pattern.A good system in place can help you during your job search.Create good habits and use them to your advantage whether it’s brushing up on industry knowledge, working on becoming healthier so you feel better, or even refreshing your skills on something you haven’t done lately.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember your social media is visible.Keep controversial, opinionated content out of it.Your potential future employer will probably look at it to get a better feel for who you are.Yes, it’s your personal space, but you’d be mistaken if you believe it won’t be checked.Employers want to not only know if you can do the job, but what type of person you are and if your values align with theirs.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think both vertically and horizontally.Are there positions you may not have thought of for employment which may actually be a fit for your skills?Are you open to new opportunities you hadn’t considered?</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set goals for yourself.Do something that keeps you inspired and motivated and make it a reward for the time you spend doing your job search.It will help you when you’re lacking the drive to keep moving forward in what may feel like a stagnant situation.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t control the situation, but you can control your actions.What you do is up to you.We can’t control changes in the world and odd situations like a random pandemic that disrupted all our lives, but we can change how we look at things and how we react.Keep perspective in mind and adjust as needed.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the biggest things you want to work on is staying focused on the end goal.It’s easy to get discouraged.Life isn’t moving along like you expected it to be.But, that’s okay.Sometimes, the challenges that we face make us stronger, and force us to think outside of the box.This could end up being a blessing in disguise.What if you find the perfect job you’ve always wanted?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go into your job search with anticipation and hope rather than dread, and your entire mindset will shift with you.You project who you are and what you’re feeling to others more than you realize through simple things like body language.Embrace the challenge before you and know that you’ll eventually get over the hurdle and land the right job.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
