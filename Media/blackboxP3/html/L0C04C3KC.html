they know what 'gain of function' experiments are.If they don't, slap them in the face.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.newsweek.com/controversial-wuhan-lab-experiments-that-may-have-started-coronavirus-pandemic-1500503</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer that Fouchier came up with was a technique known as 'animal passage,' in which he mutated the bird-flu virus by passing it through animals rather than cell cultures.He chose ferrets because they were widely known as a good stand-in for humans—if a virus can jump between ferrets, it is likely also to be able to jump between humans.He would infect one ferret with a bird-flu virus, wait until it got sick, and then remove a sample of the virus that had replicated in the ferret's body with a swab.As the virus multiplies in the body, it mutates slightly, so the virus that came out of the ferret was slightly different from the one that went into it.Fouchier then proceeded to play a version of telephone: he would take the virus from the first ferret and infect a second, then take the mutated virus from the second ferret and infect a third, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing the virus through 10 ferrets, Fouchier noticed that a ferret in an adjacent cage became ill, even though the two hadn't come into contact with one another.That showed that the virus was transmissible in ferrets—and, by implication, in humans.Fouchier had succeeded in creating a potential pandemic virus in his lab.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>da37</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P4 lab in Wuhan was built by the French,
