so keep yourself to the edge of the lane allowing others to turn at the wall, turning head away and allowing others to maintain social distancing measures.'</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full list of guidelines can be found on the Swim England website here.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will school swimming lessons resume?</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the guidelines on the Swim England website, 'School swimming has been able to continue during the national lockdown for those pupils attending school in person.From 8 March when schools return to face-to-face learning for all pupils then they will all be able to undertake school swimming lessons, either in their own school pool if the school has one, or in a public pool if it is open.'</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it safe for elderly people, or those with health conditions to return to the pool?</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swimming is a fantastic activity for elderly people and those with disabilities.At the moment, swimming pools are not allowed to open, meaning those who are elderly or have health conditions will not be able to use the facilites.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I wear a face mask in the pool?</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it is not necessary to wear a face mask or covering in the pool.In their guidelines, Swim England say, 'When the mask/covering becomes wet it makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microorganisms.The most important preventative measure during exercise is to maintain physical distance.'</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm BAME - is it safe to return to the pool?</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been widely reported that BAME groups are at higher risk of contracting Covid-19.In their FAQ's to returning to the pool Swim England recognise this, writing, 'BAME groups are at higher risk but it remains unclear if this is genetic, related to co-morbid disease or behavioural (including community).The same rules apply for everyone but their risk is higher and it is a personal choice to partake in activities under the current scientifically supported operational guidance.No further adjustments need to be made.This is also true of those older and with other co-morbid disease.There is no such thing as no risk with covid and everyone doing anything has to strike a balance.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you can swim in the sea or in a lake.The Government guidelines state:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should minimise time spent outside your home, but you can leave your home to exercise.This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can exercise in a public outdoor place:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by yourself</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the people you live with</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with your support bubble (if you are legally permitted to form one)</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a childcare bubble where providing childcare</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or, when on your own, with 1 person from another household</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes but is not limited to running, cycling, walking, and swimming.Personal training can continue one-on-one unless everyone is within the same household or support bubble.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depressed woman at home</figcaption></p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exercise and coronavirus study</figcaption><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like this article?</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign up to our newsletter</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to get more articles like this delivered straight to your inbox.</em><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-13T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Jane McGuire</p></p><p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-13</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-21</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04AJOS</p></body></html>
