immunologist.</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quote A widely-reposted 2021 facebook post claiming that the mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 could cause prion diseases was based on a paper by Classen.The paper 'COVID-19 RNA based vaccines and the risk of prion disease' was published in Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, whose publisher, Scivision Publishers, is included in Beall's list of publishers of predatory journals.Vincent Racaniello, professor of Microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, described the claim as 'completely wrong'.[1][6][7] Tulane University virologist Robert Garry stated that Classen has offered no evidence for the three pillars of his argument: that the sequence overlaps between the Pfizer vaccine are greater than occur with any randomly-selected stretch of RNA, or that the vaccine could cause zinc to be released and that doing so would affect its purported targets as he proposes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Bart_Classen</blockquote></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further info:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COVID-19 vaccines, prion disease, and Alzheimer‚Äôs: Another old antivax lie is new again</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quote Antivax immunologist J.Bart Classen recently published a paper claiming that mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines can cause prion disease leading to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia.What are prions, and can these vaccines cause prion disease?Unsurprisingly, Classen is just wildly speculating based on highly implausible biology........What are prions?Prion diseases are more properly referred to as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and represent a rare form of progressive neurodegenerative disorders that can affect both humans and animals.The most famous prion diseases in animals are bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as 'Mad Cow Disease'), scrapie, and chronic wasting disease; in humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and kuru.These diseases have a long incubation period and produce in the brain characteristic spongiform changes associated with loss of neurons with no inflammatory response.The causative agents for these diseases are prions.According to the CDC: The term 'prions' refers to abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and are able to induce abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins called prion proteins that are found most abundantly in the brain.The functions of these normal prion proteins are still not completely understood.The abnormal folding of the prion proteins leads to brain damage and the characteristic signs and symptoms of the disease.Prion diseases are usually rapidly progressive and always fatal.......So, basically, although the claim that vaccines could transmit prions entered the antivaccine lexicon of disinformation in the 1990s, after billions upon billions of doses of vaccines for which the viral stock was grown in FBS-containing media, there remains no good evidence that vaccines have ever been contaminated with prions or ever caused a single case of prion disease in humans or animals....</blockquote><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-05-26T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>NRSKarenRN, BSN</p></p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17 hours
