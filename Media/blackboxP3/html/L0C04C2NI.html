the epicentre of coronavirus – was infected in November and could be patient zero, a bombshell report which emerged earlier in March says.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPREAD ACROSS THE WORLD</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unnamed 55-year-old contracted COVID-19 on November 17 – weeks before it was previously believed to have infected humans, government data shows.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the South China Morning Post, the Chinese government has identified 266 people who were infected in 2019.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the authorities in China only became aware that they were dealing with a new strain of virus in late December.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a whistleblower medic from Hubei alerted officials on Dec 27 up to five new cases were being reported in China each day, it has emerged.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's thought that by finding Patient Zero their blood could act as a baseline from which to measure the virus' behaviour, characteristics and mutations.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical science journal The Lancet earlier this year published an update into the first known clinical reports of the virus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large group of Chinese researchers reported that 13 of the first 41 cases had no link to the seafood market in Wuhan.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University, said: 'The presumed rapid spread of the virus apparently for the first time from the Hua'nan seafood market in December did not occur.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Instead the virus was already silently spreading in Wuhan, hidden among many other patients with pneumonia at this time of the year.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The virus came into that marketplace before it came out of that marketplace.'</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'IT CAME FROM BATS'</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial College London infectious diseases expert Neil Ferguson told The Guardian that officials needed to prepare for the possibility that containing the epidemic might not be possible.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bats remain the number one suspect for the origin of the disease, as the animals have a unique immune system which enables them to tolerate viruses.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lucey argued that human and animal specimens collected during 2018 and 2019 must be tested for the virus or its antibodies and all other animal markets must be put under observation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There might be a clear signal among the noise,' he said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virus belongs to the same family as SARS which killed nearly 800 people between 2002 and 2003.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-26T17:36:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Mark Hodge</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2NY.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04949B.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04949A.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2N3.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2N1.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2N4.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2N5.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2NB.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2N6.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2N9.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2N7.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2N8.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2O0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2NX.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2O1.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C2NZ.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-03-26</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-13</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04C2NI</p></body></html>
