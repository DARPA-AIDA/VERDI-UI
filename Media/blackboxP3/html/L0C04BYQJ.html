Nationwide Lockdown to ‘Revive Economy’</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Biden’s Covid advisor Dr.Michael Osterholm called for an unconstitutional 4-6 week nationwide lockdown 'like they did in New Zealand and Australia.'Osterholm said a 6 week nationwide lockdown would get Covid under control and revive the economy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of half assed logic is this?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 week nation wide lockdown!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We could pay for a package right now to cover all of the wages, lost wages for individual workers for losses to small companies to medium-sized companies or city, state, county governments.We could do all of that,' Osterholm said.'If we did that, then we could lockdown for four-to-six weeks.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's the effing point there?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If everyone is locked down your payin the government TO DO WHAT ?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EVERYONE IS LOCKED THE EFF DOWN!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shutting down businesses and paying people for lost wages for four to six weeks could help keep the coronavirus pandemic in check and get the economy on track until a vaccine is approved and distributed, said Dr.Michael Osterholm.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the EFF they gonna do here?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy in bulk ?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure create a run and empty shelves in a matter of hours.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And well SINCE YOUR LOCKED THE EFF DOWN.</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means no deliveres

understand and exactly what happened in New Zealand with an election looming.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lock down for 6 weeks, once you've passed a time threshold in the lockdown reduce the amount of 'covid' deaths and get it to pretty much 0 at the end of 6 weeks, once 6 weeks has passed attribute the deaths correctly to what ever the reasons are and you've cured your country of covid!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all knew this was going to happen.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-11T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
