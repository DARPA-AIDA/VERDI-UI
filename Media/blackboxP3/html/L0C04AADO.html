the prospect of a domestic corporate tax rate rise to 28%, from the 21% levy set by former-President Donald Trump in 2017.That plan too faces stiff opposition within Congress</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies have come in for withering criticism for paying little or no U.S. federal tax, and Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos said this week he supported hiking tax rates to overhaul infrastructure.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UBS analysts predict that a 28% tax rate would deliver a 7.4% hit for S 500 companies’ earnings per share.They expect the hike to go into effect in 2022, though at a slightly lower 25% rate, which would result in a 3.6% earnings hit.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Joe Biden signalled on Wednesday he was willing to negotiate how much U.S. companies would pay.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pimco managing director and the head of public policy Libby Cantrill dismissed fears of a major equity setback.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'While tax increases are likely on the horizon, they are also likely to be watered down in the final version, take longer to pass, be less of a headwind to economic growth, and, as a result, give even more runway for equities and risk assets to rally,' Cantrill told clients in a blog last month.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Reporting by Thyagaraju Adinarayan, Sujata Rao in London;
