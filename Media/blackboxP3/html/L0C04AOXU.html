intelligence and its failure against COVID-19</h1><p>Artificial intelligence and its failure against COVID-19</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 Sep 2020</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Julian Estevez.Arthur Clarke, the famous scifi writer, used to say that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is due to a certain magical thinking that governments hoped, and above all, allocated funding, to the development of artificial intelligence tools against COVID-19.But the illusory state soon came to an end, and already in April of this year, the UN announced that practically all the artificial intelligence developed against the pandemic was almost useless.What did go wrong with this almighty technology, and why that did not help us this pandemy?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientific discipline of which we speak has been used mainly on four fronts in the fight against the virus: prediction of the spread; diagnosis; drug and vaccine development; social control.Let's see what happened in each of them:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prediction of the spread</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anticipating the expansion will of this virus is not the same as doing it with that of Zika, the flu, malaria, or any other.Data is essential, and we are not yet in a position to have a good, consolidated and homogeneous base among all countries.These types of algorithms, like neural networks, are capable of predicting based on the data that has been introduced to them.They make sense of the past, but they do not guess the future.In other words, we have not been able to correctly introduce the virus's expansion history into these algorithms.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An event like this pandemic, which is not based on anything past and whose operation is unknown to us, it is the kryptonite of artificial intelligence.Additionally, many flare-up detection and prediction models are based on collecting and understanding written text from different media and search engines.Obviously, this source has been totally blown up right now, and it brings more errors than certainties.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diagnosis</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the battlefront where the most resources have been invested to develop smart digital solutions.Mainly, machine-learning techniques have been used to help diagnose from X-rays, based on a series of images and patterns, the appearance or not of the fearsome virus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of opacity around these tools.Each hospital is proud of having achieved the best algorithm to achieve this.Especially in the case of China.But when push comes to shove, it is discovered that the validation of this software has been done with 35 or 50 patients, which is a complete joke for the scientific community.The most serious experiment has obtained X-ray samples from 13,000 patients.It is a first step, but of course, the solution is far from being widely implanted in hospitals in time to fight the current pandemic.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disease best treated by artificial intelligence is diabetic retinopathy, which has been studied for many years, and according to Google itself, the tool is far from replacing health professionals.So it is not reasonable to expect intelligent applications for COVID-19 in this occasion.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug and vaccine development</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this aspect, I will not stop long.Artificial intelligence has helped on other occasions to check which combinations of molecules can give rise to new drugs.But we are facing a very unknown disease, and the candidate vaccines that are emerging are being developed with the experience of highly specialized human teams.So the machines will not reach this flank of the fight against COVID-19 in time either.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social control</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only area where artificial intelligence is succeeding.This fact is ethically debatable, but the fact is that many societies are using recognition cameras to identify possible infected subjects, drones to warn their citizens that they expose themselves to fines for not keeping quarantine, or software that helps predict how they move.citizens within a small area.This in turn may be fueling the data processing monster.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bombastic announcements and big promises of global change through artificial intelligence.The tide went out and now you can see who was naked and who was not.And it is the techniques of social control that have been deployed the easiest and fastest, and the ones that citizens perceive most closely.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have reviewed the aspects of the fight against COVID-19 that we will not reach with the current algorithms, what is the lesson of all this?The UN, in the previously cited report, advises to continue making efforts in this field, and not abandon them when the COVID-19 pandemic withdraws.Other outbreaks will reappear in the future, it is certain, and the accumulated experience in the critical moments of 2020 will serve as the basis for being able to accurately predict the spread and diagnosis of outbreaks in the future.This is the case with dengue or Zika disease.The results of prediction of outbreaks of these viruses were not obtained at the moment in which they emerged with force, but in a period of between two and four years later.In fact, this type of algorithm is proving very useful to predict the first outbreaks of the dengue virus and its spread.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a reflection: in December 2019, a Canadian pandemic prediction startup called BlueDot, alerted authorities that a major threat was originating in Wuhan.It was not until many days later that the WHO did not announce it until 9 days later, perhaps when it was too late and the virus had spread to several countries.So, are we willing to take that leap of faith that allows us to trust technology?Or were they talking about that when they said that artificial intelligence would dominate us?As Edward O Wilson said, we have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;References:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naud√©, Wim.'Artificial intelligence vs COVID-19: limitations, constraints and pitfalls.'Ai Society
