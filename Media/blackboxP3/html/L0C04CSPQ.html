a tracking microchip that will be injected into individuals is ALTERED.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The video starts with a commentary from Bill Gates, who speaks on developments such as moving away from cash operations to a digital system.Mr Gates goes on to describe advances in the health field, saying, '…innovations like vaccines, we need a measuring system that tracks the vaccine…:'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the video has been edited to create a misleading combination from two parts of his speech during the Alliance for Financial Inclusion’s 2013 Global Policy Forum (GPF), held in September that year.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original video shows that Mr Gates referred to vaccines as an example of the breakthrough innovations that have changed the future for billions of people.Later, he talks about a ‘measurement system’, but in reference to the need for a system that tracks progress and ensures participants benefit from financial inclusion, and not vaccines.The two points in the original video are cut and put together, hence altering the meaning.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The video also includes footage from the launch of a United Nations report on digital cooperation in 2019, which appears at timestamp 1:33.The panel at the launch included Mr Gates’ wife, Melinda, and Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the video includes authentic commentary from Ms Gates and the business mogul, when paired up within news reports of microchips, these remarks become sinister.In the altered video, the co-chair of the Gates Foundation notes that technology gives incredible opportunities to create 'the world that we want'.But the full footage shows Ms Gates was referring to the use of technology to ensure a 'more just and humane world'.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About seven minutes into the talk, the moderator asks Mr Ma to explain how digital technology can help in doing business, to which he responds saying the most important element is in helping women, small businesses and developing countries harness resources to reach more people.Nothing in the businessman’s remarks mentions vaccines.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctored video includes other clips from old news reports about the microchip technology in humans, that are unrelated to the COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At minute 3:00, it includes footage from an authentic</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PBS NewsHour</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show, but the comment by anchor Judy Woodruff, is edited and the words are selectively cropped to make it appear she said people who support the implantation of microchips do it to 'take back control.'However, while the original footage shows the broadcast indeed covered the use of human microchips, Ms Woodruff’s sentence made reference to those who are in favour of the practice, who feel it enables them 'take back control of their personal data.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, investigations by PesaCheck reveal the clips are taken from different events and years and combined together into one video to mislead audiences.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PesaCheck has looked into the video shared on Facebook claiming that the COVID-19 vaccine will contain a tracking microchip that will be injected into individuals at the time of vaccination, and finds it to be ALTERED.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on
