Ang dami nag-false-negative at nag-false-positive,' she said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Translation: Proper timing is needed because antibodies do not show up if one is not sick.There have been many false-negative and false-positive results.]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reliance on these antibody tests might have contributed to the spread of COVID-19 in the province of Cebu, Vergeire said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'[It's not] accurate that’s why DOH does not recommend it,' she said.'We are just wasting our resources if you use this for screening.'</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DOH: Isolate returning residents</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the health department, the best practice is for local officials in low-risk areas to require a two-week isolation for returning residents from high-risk areas, whether they are tested or not.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those coming from low-risk areas should be isolated and tested if they have symptoms.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, travelers who are only passing through the province should be checked for any COVID-19 symptoms as well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, local officials will be able to keep the ones who are possibly infected away from the community during the period that they are supposed to be infectious.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Halimbawa galing Metro Manila, isolate niyo yan for 14 days,' Vergeire explained.''Pag nakatapos kayo ng labing-apat na araw na hindi nag-develop ng symptoms ang individual, you can let them reintegrate in the community.They are okay.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Translation: For example, the person coming from Metro Manila should be isolated for 14 days.After 14 days and the individual did not develop any symptoms, you can let them reintegrate in the community.They are okay.]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DOH also assured local officials that they will be informed of the returning residents’ arrival at least two to three days ahead of schedule.This will give them time to prepare the isolation areas, it said.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-08-20T12:57:56<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Carolyn Bonquin</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04APL0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-08-20</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-21</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04APKY</p></body></html>
