That 10% to the 'big man' charge should not be ignored..If the same charge had been made about Trump there would be Democrats asking for the death penalty..There is certainly room for suspicion of meetings with a political Chinese person like this since the Biden family has compromised their connections with China..</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
