range, 19-99; 54% women, 58% Black) with diverse backgrounds.Researchers used univariate and multivariate logistic regression to analyze variables such as age, sex, race, ABO blood group, comorbid conditions, disease severity (based on ICU admission) and intubation as predictors of mortality, based on survival data updated July 15.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About one-third of patients (32.6%; n = 485) had blood type A, whereas 276 (18.5%) had blood type B, 658 (44.2%) had blood type O, and 69 (4.6%) had blood type AB.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the 469 patients (31.5%) who required ICU admission, 370 were intubated.By last follow-up, 411 patients (27.6%) had died.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results showed no association between ABO blood groups and Rhesus factor and ICU admission, intubation or death.However, multivariate analysis revealed significant associations of mortality with age of 65 years or older (OR = 4.27; 95% CI, 3.19-5.71), male sex (OR = 1.57; 95% CI, 1.23-2.01), white race (OR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.14-1.86) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.09-2.04).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers noted that Black patients appeared nearly 40% less likely to die than white patients (OR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44-0.7).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramo said although COVID-19 severity may be affected by socioeconomic circumstances, these factors are difficult to quantify.She said the definition of 'disease severity' has evolved over time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Admission to the ICU, which has been used as an indicator of disease severity, has really changed since the beginning of the pandemic,' she said.'It continues to vary based on availability and workflow at hospitals.'</p><p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrombosis and COVID-19</h4></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the retrospective study conducted at Rush University Medical Center, researchers reviewed the records of 1,265 patients with COVID-19 who underwent treatment at the institution between March 1 and June 26.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis included 138 patients who had a thromboembolism confirmed by imaging.A total of 102 patients with thrombosis and 402 without thrombosis had known blood types that were used in the analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers found no significant variation in blood type prevalence among patients with COVID-19 vs.the general population without COVID-19 (type A, 34.3% vs.32.7%; type AB, 2.9% vs.4.2%; type B, 16.7% vs.14.9%; type O, 46.1% vs.48.1%).Similarly, results showed no significant difference among blood types in incidence of thrombosis (type A, 23.3%; type AB, 15%: type B, 20.7%; type O, 18.7%) or mortality (type A, 20.7%; type AB, 15%; type B, 13.4%; type O, 21.8%).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding her study’s different findings on blood type compared with previous reports, Rao said her study was limited by its small sample size.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We started with more than 1,000 patients who were COVID-19 positive between March and June at our institution.We ended up with only about a hundred patients who had reported blood types and experienced thrombosis,' she said.'That’s a very small percentage of what we originally started with.I think in future studies, we would want to study a bigger population of patients with thrombosis.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study co-author, Shivi Jain, MD, assistant professor of internal medicine in the division of hematology and director of diagnostic bone marrow services at Rush University Medical Center, also noted that patients with COVID-19 and thrombosis generally are sicker.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To get blood typing, you would have to have some threshold of severe disease,' she said.'So, that may have skewed how we collected data, since only a small number of the original 1,000 or so patients had reported blood types.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rao said the study reflects an overall effort to learn more about the factors involved in COVID-19 severity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That’s precisely why we wanted to conduct this study.The risk factors for COVID-19 are somewhat known, but we feel it is very important to also look into more factors, such as blood type, that affect COVID-19 severity,' she said.</p><p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;References:</h4></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramo, et al.Abstract 104.Presented at: ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition (virtual meeting);
