FRAUD called Obama (known as Barry Soetoro, too) is a disgusting page in American history, whose rise to the Top was the demonic proclamation of the beginning of America's 'transformation' (destruction).As posted on AFF, 'OBAMA RIPS BIBLE THE BIBLE TO SHREADS, SAYS THIS ABOUT KORAN!'Even back in 2006 that 'community organizer' (a race baiter and hidden Muslim) and 'D' rising then 'star' pre-destined (by Washington DC 'swamp' choice) to throw then 'women champion' Hillary under the bus in 2008 elections, proclaimed '</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;religious leaders should not speak out against publicly-funded contraception or gay marriage.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' None paid attention as corrupt Media narratives were just about Obama's 'hope change' and fake Peace, which Barak is going to bring to America and the world.And now, in 2021, his then (for 8 lawless shameless years!)VP pawn Biden is speeding up with America's final 'transformation' (total destruction) into a lawless territory called 'global village' run by one 'D' party 'democratic' TYRANNY pawns assigned by Washington DC 'swamp'.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

nothing, there is no case, fake news nothing burger</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4/7/21 at 7:42 pm EDT by National Zero</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question Is Can and Will Donald Pay the Bill?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Trump Organization has hired Ronald Fischetti, an experienced New York criminal-defense attorney, to represent it in Manhattan prosecutors’ investigation into the business dealings of the former president and his company.Mr. Fischetti, 84 years old, is a former law partner of Mark Pomerantz, the former federal prosecutor working on the investigation for the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. Mr. Pomerantz was sworn in as a special assistant district attorney in February and is now on leave from law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton Garrison LLP.‘I am so pleased that Ron has been added to the team,’ said Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for the Trump Organization.‘He brings extraordinary experience, a depth of knowledge and wisdom that is invaluable and that we so appreciate'' the Wall Street Journal reports.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Trump Organization retained Mr. Fischetti earlier this week, Mr. Fischetti confirmed.‘I’m delighted that I’m going to be on the defense of this,’ he said.Mr. Vance’s office has said it is investigating possible bank, tax or insurance fraud.Prosecutors have subpoenaed information from former President Donald Trump’s banks, lenders, an insurance broker and other parties, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.They are examining financial transactions at Manhattan properties including Mr. Trump’s flagship Trump Tower; Seven Springs, an estate in Westchester, N.Y.; and a hotel in Chicago, The Journal reported.Mr. Trump has called the investigation a ‘witch hunt.’After the U.S. Supreme Court in February cleared the way for Mr. Vance, a Democrat, to obtain his tax returns, Mr. Trump called the probe ‘all Democrat-inspired in a totally Democrat location.’He added, ‘We will win!’</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before hiring Mr. Fischetti, people close to Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization had reached out to lawyers in New York for recommendations or to discuss representing the former president or his company, people familiar with the matter said.Some of the people who received calls were former prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney’s office, and many had a reputation for being aggressive advocates, the people said.'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-12T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
