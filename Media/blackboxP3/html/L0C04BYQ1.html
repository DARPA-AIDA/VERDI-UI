looks set to Announce 1 month Lockdown for England</h1><p>Boris Johnson looks set to Announce 1 month Lockdown for England</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as the tier system isn't cutting the mustard it's believed that in an address to the Nation which was scheduled for 5pm Johnson will anounce the lockdown which will end on December 2nd.Obviously it's after 5pm now so I guess the finishing touches are still being made to the plans.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boris Johnson , the man who saved Christmas !</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me it's the wrong move should the plan be announced , it's time to accept the fact that we're going to have to live with COVID and its consequences or face economic ruin , we've seen that lockdowns don't work and the cost both Human and financial isn't worth the short term gain.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more lockdowns !</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edit on 31-10-2020 by gortex because: (no reason given)</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

asinine.Im not one of those that balks at masks.I wear mine, at least when going into public places.And see no issue with masks.But lockdowns?Just stupid.</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FWIW, the

agree.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that there are steps you can take such as a stoping visits to hospitals/old folks homes, get people working from home where possible, using masks, even a competent track and trace (controversial I know)...</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am not convinced that national lockdowns work.</blockquote></p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

of the problem with Covid has been communication with the public.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I blame that on the media and government, as well as I have to say in part the public at large not doing their own research.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be an unrealistic expectation that this virus can be medically eradicated when the truth is that virtually no virus has ever been medically eradicated (small pox being a notable exemption).Instead we need to shift this unrealistic expectation towards the more realistic exception of social eradication, like what we have done with HIV where by society just learns to live with the virus.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-10-31T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
