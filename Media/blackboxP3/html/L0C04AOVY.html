researchers can now tap into to tell you almost instantly if you're contagious with COVID-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Breath is a window into the rest of the body,' said Doctor Mike Lynn, CEO of Hound Labs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it contains valuable information.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Your breath has a lot of information from your body's response to particular conditions, including COVID-19,' said Dr. Mangilal Agarwal, Professor of Mechanical and Energy Engineering at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using breath to detect things from alcohol to marijuana, low blood sugar in diabetics, and now COVID-19, is relatively new in the medical field.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Perena Gouma has been studying breath-based diagnostics for 20 years.She said she’s a pioneer in the industry.She’s been developing a breathalyzer to detect COVID-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It’s a portable handheld breathalyzer and you exhale once, and in 15 seconds you have an answer,' said Dr. Gouma, an Ohio State University professor.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The device has selective gas sensors for detection.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'These chemicals we call the biomarkers, when they signal a particular disease or metabolic disorder,' Dr. Gouma said.'Mine says I’m going to look for a biomarker.I’m going to look for the biomarkers of COVID.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Dr. Gouma says the device is the first breath test submitted to the FDA, with an accuracy of 96%.But there’s more than one way to develop this idea.Another way is similar to how dogs can detect with their sense of smell.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the idea behind Hound Labs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We measure substances that come out of breath, the actual substance itself, the molecular structure,' Dr.Mike Lynn said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hound Labs has been focusing on a cannabis breathalyzer, but recently worked on a COVID-19 breathalyzer as well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They blow through the device, there's a disposable cartridge that collects the breath in a very unique way, and that disposable cartridge is then what contains the viral samples that goes ultimately to PCR,' he explained.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process is similar to how COVID-19 nasal swab PCR tests are processed in labs.Dr. Lynn said he noticed something interesting through the research.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'People who have positive nasal swabs don't necessarily have COVID-19 in their breath,' Dr. Lynn said.'On the other hand, those people that do have COVID-19 in breath, they are much much much more likely to spread it widely.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, he hopes to develop more data on this idea.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is so much that is unknown about super spreaders, about those that really transmit this disease widely whereas others transmit very, very little,' he said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers are hoping this breathalyzer concept is just another tool in the toolbox to better understand the spread of COVID-19 for both personal use and use in larger spaces.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You can use it as a screening tool at airports, sporting events, schools,' Dr. Gouma explained.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Breath research, there’s no question, it’s on the cusp of a revolution.What we can measure in breath now,' Dr. Lynn said.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-02-17T13:20:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Chloe Nordquist</p></p><p><p><img
