reverse course I'm that guy shivering walking blocks in my togs.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-20T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

spew it into the air.Not sure about the complete accuracy of that but......</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-20T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

might be carrying but are unaware of?If you have to travel to get to OW, even in a car, you are risking an accident or breakdown; if you get into trouble in OW, valuable emergency resources would need to be diverted.We don't really know how long the virus survives on surfaces, and certainly in my neck of the North Yorkshire woods, if we're relying on ambient heat and sunlight to kill the virus, we're definitely going to be needing a vaccine!Public transport is a whole other thing again in terms of risk of spreading infection that you may be carrying unknowingly.I am as desperate to be swimming outdoors as the next person, but I strongly believe that for now social solidarity trumps the desire to swim, and that social solidarity is best expressed by those of us who can keeping our heads down and staying out of the way, so that those keeping our essential services up and running can maximise their chances of doing their jobs safely.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, my current fantasy is that I'm released out into a fully functioning world for just one single day - I would get my hair cut, get my creaking back decrunched by my osteopath, drive to the Lake District, swim around the biggest lake I can find until I'm completely exhausted, cook up a feast of beans on toast in the camper van and then fall into a deep, post-swim snooze.Not for a while maybe, but I can dream...</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-20T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>KarenT</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the biggest risk is that we

early!</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-20T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>abbygirlrose</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That series of two articles by the LA Times was a tragic case of really bad reporting and unclear, emerging science that was presented before it was fully baked.This was the first article: https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-02/coronavirus-ocean-swimming-surfing-safe-beaches-los-angeles</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of us called bullshit on it because it relied so heavily on a chemist, rather than a virologist, and seemed to overlook some basic tenets of what we do know about the virus, namely that UV light destroys it and the Pacific Ocean is not the same as the local sewage plant.The researcher, Kim Prather, was barraged with all sorts of messages about how poorly done and sensationalized the piece was, to which she responded that her statements had been mangled by the reporter.Check out her lengthy Facebook post that explains that happened and what she was actually trying to say: https://www.facebook.com/kim.prather2/posts/10158026519302591</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as a member of the media myself, I'm cautious when someone insists they were taken out of context as a reason for defending a piece that met with a lot of criticism.It's an easy crutch to blame the messenger, especially when dealing with complicated material.But in this case, I believe the researcher.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the reporter comes back with a second piece a few days later https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-11/coronavirus-danger-california-beaches that 's just as confusing as the first and does not actually correct the record, but rather doubles down on some previously bad reporting.I'm disappointed in the LA Times for how this was handled.I think a different reporter should have handled the follow up, or the paper should have issued a retraction of the first piece.Instead, it seems to be a source of increased traffic and thus is allowed to stand.This isn't a good look.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that said, the simple answer to the original question is: stay the hell home.The more people try to circumvent stay-at-home orders and go swimming, the longer such orders are going to remain in place.It's like an old swim coach I had who would give sets verbally (never in writing) to force us to pay attention.If we did the set wrong, we'd just keep doing it until we finally got it right.There was one particularly complicated set that took us 3 tries to get right.We were supposed to do a 4K workout that day.We ended up at 10K because we just didn't get the message.It's kind of the same thing here: Stay home.Stay home.Stay home.And wash your filthy mitts.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

railing.Not fancy.Inch wide pajama elastic didn't roll.Anyone used to swimming with a tow buoy should be able to tie a length of rope to the strap and secure it to a post- maybe incorporating heavy duty bungie if you want a bit of stretch.</blockquote></p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-11T16:44:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

steps to shelter and prepare.Public pools closed mid-March, but we have mostly been able to continue swimming OW.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the more difficult times was a temporary but complete beach/water closure intended to deter tourists from visiting over Easter weekend.I found solace in immersing myself building a backyard pool which then begat the first documented crossing of the Circle Channel -- scroll down and look for Circle Channel 'ratified' by Monterey Bay Swimming Association.Many thanks to Coach @joelwilson and MBSA, especially Scott Tapley for helping make this an 'official' 'swim' and to my partner Mark for videos.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hoped others could benefit from my project, thus the Observer Report contains a parts list, for those interested.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@MLamby I have a DIY tether.Since I do stationary swimming, I don't want much give in the line.I wear a belt reclaimed from an old swim buoy, some nylon line, and short (~12-18') cargo bungee looped around a stout limb of a tree, with a little cardboard around the tree to protect the bark.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternately, this pool looks like a nice upgrade from mine and comes with a tether setup.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take good care, all.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-20T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
