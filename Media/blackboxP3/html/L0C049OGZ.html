the pregnant woman as well.I am not one of them, but I don't think this is an entirely trivial argument.One might say that it's a necessary consequence of considering the fetus a human being, which is a possible consequence of religious belief.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not being burdened with that, I think of a fetus as an organism that imperceptibly develops from a small cluster of cells into what we call a baby.It's very difficult to decide what level of consideration we should give it at each step along that path.The religious take the easy way out, and just say that it magically becomes fully human at the mythical 'moment of conception' (there is no such moment; conception takes a while).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not willing to accept that the recently-introduced gametes together comprise a person whose rights should predominate over those of the person in whose body it resides.But if it will eventually develop into a human being with all the rights of any other, then in some way those rights must develop along with it.How they develop, or how our recognition of them develops, is a serious and subtle question.Deciding how to answer it is a big responsibility, which is why so many are ready to leave it to religion.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-13T15:32:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>SamWack</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'all

can produce one of two different types of immunity.These are blood immunity (IgG) and surface nose-throat immunity (IgA).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current influenza vaccines only produce blood immunity (IgG).This will protect the individual and reduce hospitalization and days in the hospital.However, it have never been shown to reduce person-to-person transmission.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reduce person-to-person transmission you must have nose-throat (IgA) antibodies.This can be produced by a vaccine made by Medimmune.However, this vaccine is now out of favor and rarely used.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very laudable to legislate the protection of school children from their fellow classmates.However, the current influenza vaccine technology does not accomplish this.We need IgA vaccines and then we can talk about legislation.Right now the data is not there.There is not one study I am aware of that shows the current blood immunity vaccines reduce human-to-human transmission of the virus.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-12T22:17:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

healthcare system capacity which right now given where the trends are heading is a good thing.Secondly to reduce symptoms if someone does have the flu so the covid alarm bells do not go off.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-16T10:07:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>I'm not a doctor</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's not how Venn Diagrams

legitimate religious reasons for refusing vaccines, but this a very small group.Meanwhile, most anti-vaxxers are Whole Foods shopping, homeopathy ding-dongs, who don't even belong to any recognized

pejorative.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lawsuit seems to be political more than religious.While a judge may not want to parse through the doctrine of anyone's faith, it would seem fairly obvious how

written laws in order to be valid.First amendment caselaw doesn’t hold this to be the case.A religious belief just has to be consistent and sincerely held (and in some cases demonstrated to be held by other people).This is actually a good thing usually; vegetarianism or anti-corporal-punishment views can be asserted as one’s religious beliefs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes more sense is to do what three states have done and remove the option for religious objection to vaccination.One’s religious beliefs don’t permit them to harm nonconsenting others, which is what spreading diseases does.We don’t get to go around stoning people and saying it’s because of religion, and we also shouldn’t get to jeopardize people’s health.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

the British-born Dr.Andrew Wakefield who concocted that so-called 'link' between vaccines and autism lost his accreditation and his license to practice medicine, and he should

religiously believing vaccines are evil.This is a longstanding consequence of the First Amendment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same reason courts are forced to punt if they have a case like a will that says 'all my money to Bob if he’s a practicing Catholic'.Courts are not allowed to make that determination.(What a testator could do is say something like 'all my money to Bob if Father Joe signs a notarized affidavit that Bob is a practicing Catholic'.Courts will enforce that because they don’t have to make any determination of what a practicing Catholic is.They only have to determine if Fr.Joe did or did not execute the document.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court can get into evidence about whether or not the people sincerely believe what they are claiming to believe, but it can’t make judgements on whether what they believe is right or wrong in the sense of 'your religious belief that vaccines are evil is an incorrect religious belief'.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can

the journal Vaccines in September and the other in the Journal of Medical Virology in June, researchers found that COVID-19 rates were lower in regions of Italy where higher percentages of adults aged 65 and older had received a flu vaccine.And in a preprint paper released in July, researchers at the Mayo Clinic and the biomedical computing company nference found that adults who had received vaccines for flu, polio, chicken pox, measles-mumps- rubella (MMR), Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), hepatitis A or B, or pneumococcal disease over the past five years were less likely to test positive for the novel coronavirus than people who had not received any of them.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For now, though, there are still more questions than answers.'As far as telling people, ‘You should go get a flu vaccine because it can protect you from COVID,’ that's a little bit of a stretch at this point,' Foxman says.But, she adds, people should still go get the flu shot—because, at the very least, 'it’s going to protect you from the flu.''</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-12T15:32:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

include: After a heavily funded marketing campaign from 2003-2005 flu shot distribution went from 30m doses to 130m doses with almost zero effect on yearly transmission rates.In fact 2017-18 saw 80k deatgs and the highest flu cases since 1969 despite 140 million vaccine doses in the US.I suppose this is largely because the flu vaccine is a guessing game of what each year's strain will be.Guess right and you are dealing with a 40% effective vaccine, guess wrong and you have squat.The flu vaccine increase has caused a big spike in the VAERS numbers in the last decade, and in in the swine flu 'pandemic' in 1967 , there were significant numbers of GB and paralysis from flu shots that lead to a class action suit.South Korea has seen.South Korea has seen 100 deaths that seem to be related to flu shots this year.There are also studies showing viral interference from flu shots may worsen the body's immune reaction to certain Coronaviruses.I find it laughable when people say things like 'the science is settled' or 'period' or 'facts' with vaccines when numerous quality studies show so many conflicting data.Don't fear the truth, seek it.There is a decision to be weighed with many vaccines.They clearly impact different immune syatems in different ways.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-13T19:38:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Peter
