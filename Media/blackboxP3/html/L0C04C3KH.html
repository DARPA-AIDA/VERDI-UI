the Center for Health Security has hosted similar events in the past, too.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not surprising that such a simulation would have focused on a type of coronavirus, said David Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University and faculty member of the university’s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamer said the goal of such a simulation — which often brings together representatives from across disciplines such as academia, public health and government — 'is to present an unknown scenario and have the groups work in teams to develop an emergency response.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They can be pretty intense.The designers try to make them very realistic,' he told FactCheck.org.'Respiratory viruses like coronavirus, like SARS, like MERS are good examples to use in a format like this because of the facility in which they can spread.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, he said, it’s important to distinguish a disease like 2019-nCoV as just one virus in a larger classification: 'This is a relatively common family of viruses, but there is quite a range of pathogenicity in the family.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claim that the Gates Foundation 'funded group who owns virus patent and is funding research for a vaccine to stop it from spreading' is similarly misleading.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patent the InfoWars story links to — No.10,130,701 — is for a mutated form of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a different coronavirus that infects poultry, but not people, as we’ve explained before.That patent was filed by the Pirbright Institute — a research institute in the U.K. that works to prevent viral diseases of livestock — and the mutations were created to weaken the virus so that it could be used as a vaccine to protect chickens from IBV.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland, told us previously that that patent has nothing 'to do with the new 2019-nCoV virus.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pirbright, addressing misinformation about its patent, said that the organization 'does not currently work with human coronaviruses' and that its 'research is focused on animal coronaviruses, primarily chickens.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Institute holds Patent no.10130701 which covers the development of an attenuated (weakened) form of the coronavirus that could potentially be used as a vaccine to prevent respiratory diseases in birds and other animals,' it said in a statement.'Many vaccines are made in this way, from flu to polio.We have not yet developed an IBV vaccine, but research is ongoing.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pirbright has received continued funding from the Gates Foundation, including for its Livestock Antibody Hub, but said its 'patented work was not funded' by the foundation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gates Foundation routinely gives money to combat diseases, including for vaccine development and delivery.It recently announced it would commit $10 million in funds and technical support to help the responders in China and Africa contain the spread of the new coronavirus.</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Editor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations</i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working with Facebook</i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to debunk misinformation shared on social media.Our previous stories can be found here.</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sources</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Awarded Grants | Pirbright Institute.'Bill Melinda Gates Foundation.Accessed 28 Jan 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Event 201 Videos.'Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.Accessed 28 Jan 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamer, David.Professor of global health and medicine, Boston University.Phone interview with FactCheck.org.28 Jan 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McDonald, Jessica.'Social Media Posts Spread Bogus Coronavirus Conspiracy Theory.'FactCheck.org.24 Jan 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Pirbright’s livestock coronavirus research – your questions answered.'Press release.Pirbright Institute.24 Jan 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Statement about nCoV and our pandemic exercise.'Press release.Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.28 Jan 2020.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-01-29T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Angelo Fichera</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C3KU.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-01-29</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-13</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04C3KH</p></body></html>
