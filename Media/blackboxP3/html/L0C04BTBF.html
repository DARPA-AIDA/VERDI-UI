command.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A former Senate committee staffer, aide to Sen.James Inhofe, and lobbyist for Murray Energy, a coal company, Wheeler told the</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washington Post</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that there is 'enough distance' between him and his former clients that he does not believe that he will be biased in his decisions as the country’s top pollution regulator.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Hampshire Senators Urge Action on PFAS Before Pruitt resigned, New Hampshire’s senators sent the administrator a letter asking for 'immediate action' to declare certain PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The designation, under the CERCLA law, would hold polluters responsible for paying for cleanup.At a conference in May, Pruitt said that the agency would propose the designation for the chemicals PFOA and PFOS.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is critical for the EPA to take immediate action to protect citizens from further contamination and ensure that responsible parties are held liable for addressing any resulting health and safety concerns,' Sens.Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen wrote.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies and Reports</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legionella Dispute Representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Veterans Affairs resigned from an advisory council that is developing technical standards to reduce the risk of transmitting Legionella bacteria in water systems, the</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detroit Free Press</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reports.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resignations were due to claims that another organization on the panel — NSF International — had conflicts of interest over its for-profit work.NSF International disputes the claims.</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Radar</h3></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing on EPA Science Rule The agency will hold a public hearing in Washington, D.C., on July 17 to discuss a proposal that would restrict the agency’s use of science in decision making.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting is open to all, but registration is required by July 15.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed rule, which was offered by ex-Administrator Pruitt, would require the EPA to use only studies with peer-reviewed, publicly accessible data.It is being reviewed by the agency’s science advisory board.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legionella Study On July 30, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will hold its third meeting in its study of reducing Legionella risks in water systems.The meeting will focus on international examples of risk reduction.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting will be webcast.Registration is free, but space is limited.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legionella are the bacteria responsible for Legionnaires’ disease, the deadliest waterborne pathogen in the United States.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camp Lejeune Meeting On August 8, in Atlanta, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry will hold a meeting to discuss health effects from drinking water contamination at Camp Lejeune.This is the latest in a series of regular meetings on the topic.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration is required to attend in person, but not for viewing the meeting online.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science Advisory Board Openings The EPA wants to fill four seats on the board that advises the agency on scientific matters.There is also a vacancy on the board’s drinking water committee.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nominations are due August 8.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal Water Tap is a weekly digest spotting trends in U.S. government water policy.To get
