rather, space that had been left empty in case of floods will now hold water, increasing water levels by 3.7 meters (12 feet).That will make available an average of 8,500 acre-feet of water per year while not increasing flood risk, according to the project review.The Audubon Society of Greater Denver has filed a complaint because 10 percent of a popular state park will be flooded to hold the extra water.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secretary Kerry on Climate Calling the planetary disruptions caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions a 'gathering storm,' Secretary of State John Kerry promised to put climate change at the center of international diplomacy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing on the State Department’s blog, Kerry cited U.S. military leaders to argue that the threat of rising seas, warmer temperatures, and longer droughts should worry government leaders across the globe.Noting the march in New York City in September, he urged the public to keep pressure on elected officials.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Speak out,' Kerry wrote.'Make your message echo in every city on Earth.Make this an issue that no public official can ignore another day.Make a transition toward clean energy – through smart investments – the inevitable, not the impossible.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense Department on Climate In response to President Obama’s executive order, the Defense Department released its 'roadmap' for adapting to climate change.Shifts in weather patterns and higher temperatures will alter the U.S. military’s missions, its training, and the operation of its bases, according to the 20-page document.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'These climate trends will clearly have implications for our militaries,' said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, speaking today to a conference of defense ministers from the Americas.'A higher tempo and intensity of natural disasters could demand more support for our civil authorities, and more humanitarian assistance and relief.Our coastal installations could be vulnerable to rising shorelines and flooding, and extreme weather could impair our training ranges, supply chains, and critical equipment.Our militaries’ readiness could be tested, and our capabilities could be stressed.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquefied Natural Gas Two proposed export terminals for liquefied natural gas will undergo environmental reviews.One would be located along the east bank of the Mississippi River in southern Louisiana.The other is a proposal by Downeast Liquefaction LLC to build a terminal on the Maine coast.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waters of the United States The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has extended the deadline for public comments on its controversial proposal to define what waters are regulated by the Clean Water Act.Comments are now due November 14.They can be submitted at</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;www.regulations.gov</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using docket number No.EPA–HQ–OW–2011–0880 or they can be emailed to</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ow-docket@epa.gov</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using the docket number in the subject line.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal Water Tap is a weekly digest spotting trends in U.S. government water policy.To get more water news, follow Circle of Blue on Twitter and sign up for our newsletter.</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett writes about agriculture, energy, infrastructure, and the politics and economics of water in the United States.He also writes the Federal Water Tap, Circle of Blue’s weekly digest of U.S. government water news.He is the winner of two Society of Environmental Journalists reporting awards, one of the top honors in American environmental journalism: first place for explanatory reporting for a series on septic system pollution in the United States(2016) and third place for beat reporting in a small market (2014).He received the Sierra Club’s Distinguished Service Award in 2018.Brett lives in Seattle, where he hikes the mountains and bakes pies.Contact Brett Walton</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2014-10-13T06:00:30<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Brett Walton</p></p><p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04AZE9.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2014-10-13</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-13</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04BVMV</p></body></html>
