Post only relavent scientific data please</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So reading a few articles on the actual mechanism of the virus, how it behaves, what it does, etc, I found these articles.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2...heds-light-on-coronavirus-infection-mechanism</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the link to the Nature Article with the pdf download.Its pretty dry reading, but it sheds light on the virus itself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://rdcu.be/b3jfG</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information is still preliminary but its telling as to why were we are at now.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The takeaway at this moment is that the virus did in fact jump from bats to humans (unknown vector point) but that the reason WHY it happened is that the virus's structure was similar enough to the protein structures of humans and a simple evolutionary step (a small mutation of sorts) allowed a strain of the virus to adhere to human cell walls and take off.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the proof of the vector point will be impossible to be known.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless, the real takeaway is that the two points of the virus: its slow mutation rate and its virulence may have been a simple mutation caused by some action and voila... where here.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also means that the virus spread may be more than what they originally thought.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also why the virus is something MORE than the simple flu and why it shouldn't be taken as such.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

possible airborne transmission.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go back to Jan in the main thread.You're reinventing the wheel (as is the US Med business).Those (98%) that 'discovered' the chicom flu on CNC Mar 1 (as the US Med business) missed a LOT.</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes airborne.Closed googles and P100. 6ft/washee hands/sneeze into elbow is drivel to calm the masses of

forwarded by Irene Ken, MD, whose daughter is supposedly an Asst.Prof.in infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University, has been makng the rounds on various forums.There are some inconsistencies with the info:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COVID-19 does not contain DNA.It is single-stranded RNA (ribo and not deoxyribonucleic acid), and transfers genetic codes from nucleus to ribosomes to make proteins:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369385/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important, as RNA requires a higher dose of UVC light than DNA to break down when sanitizing masks, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Listerine has been recommended, but is NOT 65% alcohol.It is 26.9%, not adequate to sanitizing.https://www.listerine.com/mouthwash/antiseptic/listerine-original-mouthwash#inactive-ingredients</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, full-cask-strength 151 proof rum (or Everclear) will do the job, at some added expense.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the article following below, 'pure' hydrogen peroxide is not needed to deactivate the coronavirus.Readily available, industrial 30% strength can do this in 5 minutes (see EPA Registration Number 70627-78 and others).https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This percentage is not good for hand-washing, as it can still burn skin and bleach hair...</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know who really put this out, but it would not pass peer-review at Hopkins based on these inconsistencies.The rest of the advice looks reasonable, but, I'm just an engineerâ€¦</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------------------------Circulating Internet Email----------------------------------------------------</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The virus is not a living organism, but a protein molecule (DNA) covered by a protective layer of lipid (fat), which, when absorbed by the cells of the ocular, nasal or buccal mucosa, changes their genetic code.(mutation) and convert them into aggressor and multiplier cells.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Since the virus is not a living organism but a protein molecule, it is not killed, but decays on its own.The disintegration time depends on the temperature, humidity and type of material where it lies.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The virus is very fragile; the only thing that protects it is a thin outer layer of fat.That is why any soap or detergent is the best remedy, because the foam CUTS the FAT (that is why you have to rub so much: for 20 seconds or more, to make a lot of foam).By dissolving the fat layer, the protein molecule disperses and breaks down on its own.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* HEAT melts fat; this is why it is so good to use water above 25 degrees Celsius for washing hands, clothes and everything.In addition, hot water makes more foam and that makes it even more useful.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Alcohol or any mixture with alcohol over 65% DISSOLVES ANY FAT, especially the external lipid layer of the virus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Any mix with 1 part bleach and 5 parts water directly dissolves the protein, breaks it down from the inside.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Oxygenated water helps long after soap, alcohol and chlorine, because peroxide dissolves the virus protein, but you have to use it pure and it hurts your skin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* NO BACTERICIDE SERVES.The virus is not a living organism like bacteria; they cannot kill what is not alive with antibiotics, but quickly disintegrate its structure with everything said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* NEVER shake used or unused clothing, sheets or cloth.While it is glued to a porous surface, it is very inert and disintegrates only between 3 hours (fabric and porous), 4 hours (copper, because it is naturally antiseptic; and wood, because it removes all the moisture and does not let it peel off and disintegrates.24 hours (cardboard), 42 hours (metal) and 72 hours (plastic).But if you shake it or use a feather duster, the virus molecules float in the air for up to 3 hours, and can lodge in your nose.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The virus molecules remain very stable in external cold, or artificial as air conditioners in houses and cars.They also need moisture to stay stable, and especially darkness.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, dehumidified, dry, warm and bright environments will degrade it faster.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* UV LIGHT on any object that may contain it breaks down the virus protein.For example, to disinfect and reuse a mask is perfect.Be careful, it also breaks down collagen (which is protein) in the skin, eventually causing wrinkles and skin cancer.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The virus CANNOT go through healthy skin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Vinegar is NOT useful because it does not break down the protective layer of fat.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* NO SPIRITS, NOR VODKA, serve.The strongest vodka is 40% alcohol, and you need 65%.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* LISTERINE IF IT SERVES!It is 65% alcohol.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The more confined the space, the more concentration of the virus there can be.The more open or naturally ventilated, the less.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* This is super said, but you have to wash your hands before and after touching mucosa, food, locks, knobs, switches, remote control, cell phone, watches, computers, desks, TV, etc.And when using the bathroom.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* You have to HUMIDIFY HANDS DRY from so much washing them, because the molecules can hide in the micro cracks.The thicker the moisturizer, the better.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Also keep your NAILS SHORT so that the virus does not hide there.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------------------End Internet
