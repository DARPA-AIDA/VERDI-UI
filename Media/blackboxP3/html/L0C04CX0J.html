Crescenz VA Medical Center, told CreakyJoints.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr.Baker adds that people with inflammatory arthritis who regularly take NSAIDs to ease pain don’t need to stop using these drugs unless they develop COVID-19 symptoms.'I would continue them for symptom management as long as you are not symptomatic with fever, cough, or other symptoms of viral infection.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you develop COVID-19 symptoms, you should call your health care provider for guidance about getting tested and which over-the-counter medications are best for managing your symptoms.Make sure they know what other medications you are taking to manage arthritis or other conditions.</p><p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get Free Coronavirus Support for Chronic Illness Patients</h2></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Join the Global Healthy Living Foundation’s free COVID-19 Support Program for chronic illness patients and their families.We will be providing updated information, community support, and other resources tailored specifically to your health and safety.Join now.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-03-19T11:56:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Barbara Brody</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CX0Q.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CX0U.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CX0V.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CX0T.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CU7G.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CU7N.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CU7I.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CX0N.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CX0R.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CX0W.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CX0O.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-03-19</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-06-20</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04CX0J</p></body></html>
