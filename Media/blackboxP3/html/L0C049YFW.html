oppression of the poor and of people of colour under Trump and under the GOP.Remember that the Lord tells us to avoid 'a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers'.Those who tell lies about people with good intent, those who defend ill-intentioned MAGAs who participated in the January 6th insurrection, those who try to sew discord by pretending their opponents are evil (or CCP or whatever lies you're telling yourself) fit all of

uniquely so.Fascists are part of the political spectrum, and on the statist left.The left consists of socialists, communists, AND fascists because they all believe it is the STATE that has the right to run the lives of its subjects.The political right, conversely, believes in limited government, individual rights (and responsibilities) and minimizing the power of the STATE so freedom can flourish.The left wants to run and control everything.The right wants people in control of their own lives.Aunty Anne Tifa, did you get all of your knowledge of history from that vile, deceitful screed made up by the self-professed communist Howard Zinn?Don't you know it was debunked as fiction by all of his peers?It had no footnotes, attribution, citations or references to previous scholarly volumes.Aunty Anne Tifa, obviously you're selling a bunch of re-definitions, but I'm not buying it.That ship has sailed.Elvis has left the building.The Antifa group was formed when, where, and by whom?Please, look it up.Oh wait, you're probably a leftist ideologue, therefore allergic to facts, science or reason.With the left it's 100% lies, propaganda, and 'spin' 24-7-365.25.If that fails then its violence, mayhem, rioting, murder, and arson.Evil is as evil does.'For those who do evil is reserved the outer darkness.'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
