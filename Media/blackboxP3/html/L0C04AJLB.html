other bags can be cleaned using a disinfectant wipe or spray.Wear a mask while grocery shopping, when it can be difficult to maintain social distance from other shoppers.In some areas or at certain stores, wearing a mask may be required.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Household surfaces.Regularly clean and disinfect commonly touched household surfaces — such as tables, countertops, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucet handles and sinks.The virus may stay on surfaces from hours to days.However, studies suggest that the virus is unlikely to spread by touching most common surfaces three days after a person with COVID-19 has touched them.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking water.The virus that causes COVID-19 hasn't been detected in drinking water.Water treatment facilities have processes to filter and disinfect water before it goes into your home.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close contact with people.Especially to people who don't live in your household, don't get too close.Keep the rule of social distance in mind: Try to stay 6 feet (2 meters) away from others.Respiratory droplets from the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread to a person 6 feet or closer after someone with the virus coughs, sneezes or talks, which can put you at risk if you're within that 6-foot circle.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dogs and cats.There have been reports of some pets, including dogs and cats, being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people who had the virus.Often, the animals showed no signs of being sick.The virus that causes COVID-19 mainly spreads from person to person.Experts don't consider animals to be a significant way that coronavirus spreads.But this is an area of ongoing investigation.Treat your pets as if they were people, keeping them at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people and animals outside your household and staying at home when possible.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mosquitoes and ticks.There's no evidence to suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads through mosquito or tick bites.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swimming pools, hot tubs and water playgrounds There's no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads through swimming pools, hot tubs and water playgrounds.Still, it's a good idea to keep physical distance between you and people you don't live with — at least 6 feet (2 meters) if you can — when you're at a public pool or water park.Set the face mask aside when you're in the water, as a wet mask makes breathing difficult.But wear a face mask when you're not in the water to help minimize the potential for virus spread.Stay home if you're feeling ill.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stool, urine and other body fluids.Respiratory droplets are the main source of spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.The virus has also been detected in the stool of some people who are sick with COVID-19.Experts don't know yet what the risk of transmission from stool might be, but the virus that causes COVID-19 may have the potential to spread through untreated sewage.Also unknown is whether the virus might spread through other body fluids, such as urine, vomit, breast milk or semen.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By following social distancing and your local public health guidelines, such as wearing a face mask when you go out, you help to lower your risk of infection.You also help protect other members of your community.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-09T00:00:00<br></p></p><p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C049MO6.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C049MO5.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-09</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-21</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04AJLB</p></body></html>
