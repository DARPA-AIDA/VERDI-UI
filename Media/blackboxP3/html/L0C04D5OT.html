has fined Google over €1.1 million after finding that the search engine company had committed breaches of data protection rules in its search results.In 2021, the European Court of Justice ruled that Google misled users when it came to hotel star rating systems.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware.It is considered one of the Big Five technology companies in the U.S. information technology industry, alongside Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft.</figcaption><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y8.png' style='max-width:

also potentially limit the power of the search engine giant to benefit or disadvantage small businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The investigation revealed that Google had replaced the Atout France ranking with a classification established according to its own criteria,' said the DGCCRF.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Google could be in line for further criticism, particularly as the ruling comes from a continent-wide court.The ruling would, however, also have a huge bearing on how hotel and consumer star ratings are calculated.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time, hotel star ratings in Europe were controlled by an organization known as GIPS, or the European hospitality group.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We have now settled with the DGCCRF and made the necessary changes to reflect the official French star rating for hotels on Google Maps and Search,' a Google spokesperson said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group is made up of national hotel organizations.By law, they have to include hotel ratings in their rankings.This is part of an effort to ensure that the hotel industry is fairly regulated.In order to meet their goal, they have to use hotel star ratings as a major factor in their calculations.This is why many hotel operators were concerned about being punished.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with relying on hotel star ratings was that the system was not fixed.It relied upon the honesty of the hotels themselves, which oftentimes wasn’t the case.By including hotel star ratings in their calculations, hotels could effectively skew the results in their favor.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meant that they could give themselves a more favorable rating— one that was artificially low in order to meet the legal requirements.This artificially-low hotel rating led to a lower number of complaints when customers went looking to find a hotel.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the investigation into the French affiliate has come to a close, Google has decided to fix this problem.They have introduced a new feature that will allow users to see the star rating for every hotel on their search results pages.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will allow customers to read positive and negative reviews of the hotels directly from the customers themselves.This may make it much easier for travelers to understand the different aspects of a hotel.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Google’s new feature also allows customers to sort results by the type of hotel they are looking for.This will allow tourists to focus on specific types of hotels, rather than be confused by the choices.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world becomes busier, customers want to know that they are getting quality services at affordable prices.Being able to quickly see a hotel’s star rating is one way for them to know that they are getting what they pay for.While some hotels may still have low star ratings, there are more than enough of them to choose from.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Directorate for Competition, Consumption and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) is a French administration under the Ministry of the Economy .Its purpose is to ensure the conditions of commercial exchanges between businesses in order to ensure the fairness of transactions towards consumers.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the French authorities ordered Google to start providing hotel ratings in France, it looks like the problem is only going to grow.Google only acts as the middleman, selling customers the ability to rate and review hotels.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, instead of relying solely on users’ reviews, they have introduced another means for people to rate and review a hotel.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This doesn’t mean those hotel ratings will suddenly disappear, but it does mean that Google may have to begin working harder to keep up with the demand.They are, after all, the largest search engine on the web.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you’re a curious tourist, you may be wondering if Google has gone too far to satisfy the French government.The fine is only one of several that Google has had to pay out over the past year for not complying with French law.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France has a long history of infuriating European governments for their attempts to limit free speech.While this particular case may have been an exception, other hotels could soon see the same treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxpayers have

successful filing season in his</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Closer Look</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;column.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be tax ready: Review pandemic-related changes</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year’s sweeping set of tax changes not only affected individuals and their families but may also affect the tax return they’re filing this year.A new IRS Fact Sheet explains what taxpayers need to know to file a complete and accurate tax return.The IRS recognizes that filing this year may be challenging for some taxpayers and it’s important to understand how to claim credits and deductions, get a refund timely and meet all tax responsibilities.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovery Rebate Credit helps people still eligible for Economic Impact Payments</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who may be eligible for stimulus payments, they should carefully review the guidelines for the Recovery Rebate Credit.Most people received Economic Impact Payments automatically, and anyone who received the maximum amount does not need to include any information about their payments when they file.However, those who didn’t receive a payment or only received a partial payment may be eligible to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit when they file their 2020 tax return.Tax preparation software, including IRS Free File, will help taxpayers figure the amount.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New language preferences to help taxpayers</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, this year for the first time, Forms 1040 and 1040-SR are available in Spanish, and the IRS has a new form allowing taxpayers to request that they receive information from the IRS in their preferred language.The Schedule LEP, Request for Change in Language Preference, will allow taxpayers to request information in some 20 different languages besides English.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IRS also wants to remind taxpayers of other important changes that could impact their tax return this year.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember to factor in retirement plan distributions</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some taxpayers found it necessary to take coronavirus-related early distributions from 401(k) plans and traditional IRAs in 2020.Under the CARES Act, those distributions – up to $100,000 – are not subject to the 10% additional tax that otherwise generally applies to distributions made before an individual reaches age 59 ½.In addition, a coronavirus-related distribution can be included in income in equal installments over a three-year period, and an individual has three years to repay a coronavirus-related distribution to a plan or IRA and undo the tax consequences of the distribution.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxpayers should also remember that they can make contributions to traditional IRAs until April 15, 2021, and still deduct that amount on their 2020 tax return, if eligible.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New for 2020: non-itemizers can deduct $300 for charitable cash contributions</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, charitable contributions could only be deducted if taxpayers itemized their deductions.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the CARES act, taxpayers who don’t itemize deductions may take a charitable deduction of up to $300 for cash contributions made in 2020 to qualifying organizations.For the purposes of this deduction, qualifying organizations are those that are religious, charitable, educational, scientific or literary in purpose.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now more than ever, e-file is best</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now more than ever, the safest and best way to file a complete and accurate tax return and get a refund is to file electronically and use direct deposit.Taxpayers can visit IRS.gov/filing for more details about IRS Free File, Free File Fillable Forms and Free tax preparation sites.E-filing is also available through a trusted tax professional.Free File is a great option for people who are only filing a tax return to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit, either because they didn’t receive an Economic Impact Payment or did not receive the full amount.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastest way to get a refund is to file electronically and use direct deposit.Most refunds are issued in less than 21 days, but some refunds may take longer for a variety of reasons.Taxpayers can track their refund using 'Where’s My Refund?'on IRS.gov or by downloading the IRS2Go mobile app where they’ll get a personalized refund date as soon as 24 hours after the tax return is electronically submitted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most early Earned Income Tax Credit/Additional Child Tax Credit filers should see an update to 'Where’s My Refund?'by Feb.22.The IRS cannot answer refund status inquiries unless it has been 21 days since the return was electronically filed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRS tax help is available 24 hours a day on IRS.gov, where people can find answers to tax questions and resolve tax issues online from the safety of their home.The Let Us Help You page helps answer most tax questions, and the IRS Services Guide PDF links to other
