they can never be awarded.Urgent international aid is the only way out.Raise your voice,' Blanco wrote in his Twitter account.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What happened today [Thursday] at the UN is a real shame, a slap to diplomacy (…), to Venezuelans fighting for freedom,' Bastardo tweeted.'Allowing the regime to sit on the Human Rights Council is to celebrate that socialism kills in Venezuela.'</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicolás Maduro is a Venezuelan politician serving as president of Venezuela since 2013.His presidency has been disputed by Juan Guaidó since January 2019, with much of the West recognizing the latter as Acting President.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawyer Gonzalo Himiob of the Venezuelan Criminal Court also condemned what he attributes to the fact that many countries move 'more for their own interests than for humanity.'He tweeted, 'this vote proves that Venezuelans still have a lot of work to do, so they know more about our harsh reality.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humberto Prado, from the Venezuelan Prison Observatory, also condemned the candidacy of the regime of Nicolás Maduro, for 'not meeting the necessary conditions.'He told reporters, 'the regime has been characterized for violating human rights.It is involved in disappearances, torture, cruel, degrading, and inhuman treatment.Reports from human rights organizations ratify the systematic violation of human rights in Venezuela.'According to Prado, the election represents 'a serious mistake and a tragedy.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venezuela won a seat on the UN Human Rights Council Thursday, following a vote at the UN General Assembly, despite criticism from some countries and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).The Government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza welcomed the election, which says it calls 'a victory for Bolivarian peace diplomacy.'Venezuela will take office on January 1, 2020, replacing Cuba, whose term comes to an end.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2019-10-18T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Vincent Ferdinand</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y3.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04EB97.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04EB95.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04EB99.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495XV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495XW.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495YA.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495XU.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495YI.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495Y0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y2.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495YE.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495Y7.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2019-10-18</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-07-09</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04EB91</p></body></html>
