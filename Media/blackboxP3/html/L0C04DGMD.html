Fate as the Soviets?</h1><p>Will China Assume the Same Fate as the Soviets?</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese reputation is taking a beating on the world stage.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's economy is unsustainable.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's political system holds no International appeal.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, China has a negative image on the global arena, as a result of the Coronavirus that originated there.The pandemic continues to spread, and there are over 14.8 million infected and over 600,000 deaths around the globe.China has also been heavily criticized due to its handling of Hong Kong.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic originated with a cluster of mysterious, suspected pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China.As of July 21, there have been 83,693 reported cases and 4,634 deaths from COVID-19.</figcaption><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495Y7.jpg'

Montagnier claims that China was trying to create a vaccine against HIV, and the coronavirus was accidentally released.Dr. Mongtagnier is 100% sure the virus is designed by molecular biologists.The rest of the medical community is sure it was not.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China’s handling of Hong Kong isn’t much better.The United Kingdom this week suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, in retaliation for the new security law imposed on the former British colony by China.Meanwhile, the US is embroiled in a trade war that evolved onto other spheres as well.Chinese firms Huawei and TikTok are under intense, security-related scrutiny.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, prior to the Coronavirus, China was a global factory.China was empowered by the US conglomerates since the 1980s.China did evolve in producing and designing its own goods, but the designs are often the result of copyright infringement or other forms of theft.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, China worked under a globalized economic model, based on a single global currency, the US dollar.The Chinese Yuan managed to become an alternate reserve currency.Yet, the prognosis of China being a global factory is very limited.History tends to repeat itself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last century, the Soviet Union was a global factory for the former Eastern Bloc.The Soviets manufactured a broad spectrum of products, from clothing to defense equipment.At the time of the Soviet Union’s collapse, the manufacturing collapsed in Russia along with it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1990s, there was severe poverty, and the rise of the criminal element in Russia.Russian manufacturing, besides the defense sector, is still dead almost 30 years later.This is the same fate that awaits China, minus defense.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China does not hold any share of the defense market.Therefore, the standard of living many Chinese people previously enjoyed, and the rise of the new upper and middle classes, will experience a full collapse.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russia’s saving grace continued to be oil, and the defense technologies that were resurrected and upgraded in this century.China’s defense sector is purely based on stealing other technology, as China is not capable of designing anything itself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communism does not allow creative thinking.It only allows robotic order following.That is what Chinese students are taught since childhood.Even the Soviet nuclear program was only successful due to Nazi scientists who emigrated from Germany after World War II.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hong Kong national security law is a decision adopted by the third session of the thirteenth National People’s Congress, to authorize the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) to promulgate a national security law in Hong Kong.The pan-democratic camp, human rights organisations and politicians abroad have criticised the decision as a threat to the 'one country, two systems' principle, the rule of law and civil liberties.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russia and China historically have had challenging dealings.Analyzing the last century, China has not won any wars or militarized conflicts.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China’s Military Conflicts in the Past 100 years:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sino-Mongolian Wars (1911-15): Mongolia becomes independent from China</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sino-Soviet Conflict (1929): Conflict on the Chinese Eastern railway, Soviet victory</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Sino-Japanese War (1931-37): Capture of Manchuria by Japan</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-45): Eventual capture of Eastern China by Japan, at least 10 million dead.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First (1962) and Second (1967) Sino-Indian Wars: Two major conflicts without a win for either side.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhenbao/Damansky Island Conflict (1969): After considerable loss of life, ceded by the USSR to China in 1991</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sino-Vietnamese War (1979): China forced to withdraw from Vietnam after less than four weeks of fighting</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is also losing the battle in social engineering propaganda against the US.Their attempts at propaganda is very weak and laughable.The US is winning, and Russia holds strong second place in such activities.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China’s biggest challenge is the lack of support.No one is attracted to the totalitarian regime style of governance.To note, Russian President Vladimir Putin does not openly support communism.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is not dangerous for Russia.The Kremlin will continue dealings with China, as long as it fits their own agenda.The moment China deviates from Russian interests, it will be gone.At the same time, China still does not recognize Crimea as Russian.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is still holding out hope for a relationship with the West.Given the current trajectory, the chances of such are slim to none.Putin never forgets.The Kremlin can see China not all in strategy and will do the same to China, when the right opportunity comes up.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, China can repeat the fate of the Soviet Union.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow
