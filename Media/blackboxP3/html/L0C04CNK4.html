Gen.David Sanford, deputy director of the supply chain task force.'The federal government has learned.If a state needs something, they should request it and we’ll get it to them.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet problems persist.Some states say they haven’t been getting the PPE they have requested from the federal government.Others say they have received damaged goods.Still others have largely replaced efforts to procure medical gear from the national stockpile with PPE from private vendors.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public health preparedness officials in Maine have made three recent requests to the federal government, for nitrile gloves, pipette tips and testing kits.All have gone unfilled or have been denied, said Robert Long, communications director for the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.The agency hasn’t received any supplies from the national stockpile or FEMA since midsummer, he said.</p><p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</h4><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do hospitals near you have enough key medical supplies to address the pandemic this winter?Join the conversation below.</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Mexico requested gloves from FEMA months ago; they arrived last week damaged by heat and couldn’t be used for medical procedures, according to Marisa Maez, communications director for the state’s department of health.The state turned to private vendors.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FEMA expects to deliver gloves to Maine in January, and is holding gowns and other supplies in local warehouses to deliver to the state upon request, an agency spokesperson said.FEMA is 'actively working' with the Defense Logistics Agency to address the problem of the damaged gloves in New Mexico, the spokesperson said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washington state also has turned to private vendors.Casey Katims, an aide to Gov.Jay Inslee, said the federal government has provided 11% of Washington’s protective equipment supplies since the beginning of the pandemic.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supply of surgical gloves at Alabama’s Department of Health is critically low, according to Dr.Karen Landers, assistant state health officer.She says Alabama is expecting more gloves from FEMA soon.A FEMA spokesman said an order for gloves was approved for shipment to Alabama on Nov.23.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health workers in Albany, N.Y.; Chicago; Tacoma, Wash.; and Pennsylvania have gone on strike in the past two weeks to protest insufficient personal protective equipment.Colorado Gov.Jared Polis, a Democrat, said states are trying to get by.</p><p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More on the Pandemic</h4></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenges come as the Trump administration seeks to provide a vaccine to everyone who wants it by June 2021.About one-third of states said they were 'greatly' or 'completely' concerned about having sufficient vaccine-related supplies to administer the Covid-19 shots, according to the November GAO report.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;States will get supplies such as syringes, needles, face masks and shields with the vaccines, an HHS spokeswoman said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had sent $340 million to states to support flu and Covid-19 vaccine planning, she said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trump administration only recently began sharing information with President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State leaders have said they need billions of dollars more for training, recruitment, outreach, vaccine storage and related supplies.</p><p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newsletter Sign-up</h4></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coronavirus Daily Briefing and Health

which alerts the federal government to supply and staffing shortages at hospitals and nursing homes around the country, said Henry Walke, incident manager for the CDC’s Covid-19 response.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDC analysts are working on creating alerts that identify hospitals or nursing homes that have reported a need for more masks, gowns, devices for delivering supplemental oxygen and other supplies, he said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system is robust and more integrated, he said, but the 'recent large surge in cases and hospitalizations across the nation could strain it.We’re very concerned.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HHS Protect is limited.It tracks supply issues for hospitals and nursing homes, and not personal protective equipment used and needed by workers at urgent care centers, doctors’ offices or outpatient clinics.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 42% of nurses said they are still experiencing widespread or intermittent personal equipment shortages, according to a September survey by the American Nurses Association.Over half said they were reusing masks such as N95 respirators for five or more days, a 15% increase from May.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'America’s hospitals and health systems continue to have serious concerns about PPE supply,' said Rick Pollack, president of the American Hospital Association.</p><p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘We need to rely on our creativity and not to rely on the state or federal government,’ said Jackson Baynard, chief of emergency management for

Covid-19 hot spots is also being stretched and never reached its staffing goals.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of a lack of workforce planning in the years before the pandemic, the program has had 'limited assurance that it is adequately prepared to respond to public health emergencies,' according to a June GAO report.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this continues to leave some hospitals and counties scrambling to make do as cases climb.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson Baynard, chief of emergency management in Henrico County, Va., said his county has been forced to rely on nontraditional vendors to obtain the necessary protective equipment for front-line workers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We need to rely on our creativity and not to rely on the state or federal government to take care
