Seides, M.D., director of interventional pulmonology at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital.'We’ve seen an increase in patients presenting with non-COVID-related problems who have waited a lot longer than they normally would to come to the hospital, thereby making their problems less manageable.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you develop flulike symptoms, difficulty breathing, or notice a bluish or purplish color in your lips or fingertips, call your doctor right away, Worsham says.The same goes if you use oxygen at home and find that you need more oxygen than usual.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And don’t rely on store-bought pulse oximeters — devices that go over the fingertips to measure oxygen levels — to gauge your lung health.'These can be very inaccurate and can provide false reassurance,' Worsham says.'Again, the best thing to do with breathing or oxygen concerns is to call the doctor’s office.'</p><p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do end up with COVID, keep in mind that most patients — including those with COPD — survive.'Every day we’re getting better at managing these patients,' Seides says.</h3><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-05-07T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Beth Howard</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C049JLS.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-05-07</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-08</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C049JLP</p></body></html>
