Isn't it weird that nobody has installed more sinks or handwashing stations?Sure we've got sanitizer up the yin yang but some wonder if it is safe or even effective.Hand washing is effective and has been proven with study after study to stop the spread of Covid other diseases.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illinois has (or had not sure) a restaurant called Bob Chins.They served Crab and seafood and very greasy but delicious garlic rolls.In the middle of the restaurant they had hand washing stations.It was a brilliant thing.This was well before Covid.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why haven't we seen more of these?!!!Shouldn't every grocery store have one right by the produce or even before you enter, what about at schools, or Hardware stores or other places that are 'essential'.Sure they have bathrooms, but how many people go in those?Some people don't want to go in bathrooms right now.They should have the portable sinks right out in front, just like you see at concerts and other venues.Are we going to see some health concerns in the future from all this sanitizer use?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've only seen ONE portable hand washing station since Covid started and that was at an outdoor venue that was so huge it was almost impossible to not socially distance....Just thought it was weird.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

necessarily, last I heard they said you can still get it from touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands.Even your article points that out:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand washing with soap and water for 20 seconds ‚Äî or sanitizer in the absence of soap ‚Äî is still encouraged to stop the virus‚Äôs spread.But scrubbing surfaces does little to mitigate the virus threat indoors, experts say, and health officials are being urged to focus instead on improving ventilation and filtration of indoor air.</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are saying maybe we don't need to bleach down the world but our hands are still a vector.</blockquote><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-02T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>JAGStorm</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me clarify....Handwashing is ALWAYS good for general hygiene.It is my personal opinion that people don't wash their hands enough....even pre-COVID.But my point is that increasing hand-washing is not effective in stopping the spread of COVID.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-02T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

spread of disease but certainly makes idiots feel safe or self-righteous or both.The same could be said as to why there's no mask disposal biohazard bins and why nobody says jack # about the need for disposable gloves between say customers at stores or why it's suddenly acceptable for a mask to be used 8 hours a day or more, stored in unsterile conditions and then be considered safe or effective.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've said it a bunch of times, if you're doing less than a hospital, you're not doing anything worthwhile and even hospitals can't stop disease transmission.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not like horseshoes, there's no almost sorta kinda good enough bull#.You're dealing with situations where a single drop contains hundreds of thousands to a million viral cells.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either treat it like the hazard it is or just stop the charade.Either it's worth treating.like a significant biohazard or all this is pointless nonsense.It can't be both and considering the inconsistencies and inefficacies of the measures, i'm leaning towards nonsense bull# myself and by leaning I mean I fell of the #ing cliff and i'm splattered down in the nonsense # heap.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edit on 2/1/2021 by dug88 because: (no reason given)</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-02T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

wonder.The produce is out in the open for everyone to feel and man handle.For example- with the avocado you need check the color beneath the stem break off point and give a slight squeeze to ascertain the ripeness- all requiring human contact.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day when I am sitting back and pondering the efficiency of all the sanitizing, I think trying not to touch your face while shopping, hand sanitizer in the car followed by washing your hands when you get home is a good idea.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do ask myself why after almost a year of a mask mandate why we don‚Äôt have a standard recommended efficient mask readily available for purchase instead of the thin cloth fabric that most people are wearing.It seems disingenuous for our government to say wear a mask and then not make effective masks available after this long of a time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a side note: I am an ex RN and have always loved the topic of infection control.I am less afraid now: my sister in law is PA and has gotten the Rona- she has recovered, she lost smell and taste and had 1 really bad day.She is in her 30‚Äôs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My niece, in her 20‚Äôs, who is a elementary school teacher got it and is doing well, but her sense of smell and taste has not returned yet and it has been a few weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Mom‚Äôs first cousin in his 70‚Äôs did die from the rona- I am unsure of his underlying conditions- didn‚Äôt want to ask at the risk of seeming insensitive.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edit on 2-1-2021 by Onlyyouknow because:
