practical sense, is perceived in Ashgabat as a status that allows the country to isolate itself as much as possible from its neighbors and the entire world.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is a Turkish politician serving as the 12th and current President of Turkey since 2014.He previously served as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998.</figcaption><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495YI.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants Turkmenistan to join Turkey in a possible Turkic bloc.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Turkmenistan is unique due to its political regime.The powerful elite, led by the late Saparmurat Niyazov, managed to establish not just a rigid authoritarian regime, but the only autocracy in the post-Soviet Bloc.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turkmenistan, in comparison with neighboring countries, embodies the practice of absolute state control over any manifestations of social activity.The activities of foreign and domestic NGOs are prohibited in Turkmenistan.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunities for citizens of neighboring countries to enter Turkmenistan have been reduced to zero.Nevertheless, Turkey is the only country that has visa-free travel with Turkmenistan.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turkmenistan is rich with natural gas reserves and ranks forth in the world for the supply of natural gas.Additionally, Turkmenistan has the second-largest gas field, South Yoloten.However, the data of the production and gas sales are classified by the government.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main importer of gas from Turkmenistan is China.Therefore, Turkmenistan has credit dependence on China, as gas sales to China usually are used to repay Chinese loans.To note, since last year, Russia started buying small batches of gas.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Turkmenistan lost the trust of Iran and their gas partnership has been frozen since 2017.That is one of the reasons why President Erdogan wants to solidify his relationship with Turkmenistan.The former President of Turkmenistan, Niyazov, also failed to establish symbiotic relationships with neighboring countries in Central Asia.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saparmurat Niyazov, also known as Türkmenbaşy, was a Turkmen politician who served as the leader of Turkmenistan from 1985 until his death in 2006.In his time, he was one of the world’s most totalitarian, despotic and repressive dictators.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are not interested in importing gas, as they produce it themselves, but there are possibilities to sell Turkmen gas to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.There is a possibility that China will start importing larger volumes of gas from Kazakhstan, which in turn will decrease the sales from Kyrgyzstan.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are discussions that Turkmenistan will enter an economic crisis in 2021.Turkmenistan is also denying the presence of the Coronavirus pandemic in the country, but that is not true.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turkmenistan is a Caspian country.If an agreement is reached on the division of the sea floor within the framework of the Caspian Convention, Turkmenistan will have prospects for gas supply diversification.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last year, information has been circulating that Ashgabat and Brussels are preparing to sign a framework agreement regarding the supply of Turkmen gas to the European Union, which implies the construction of a pipeline along the bottom of the Caspian Sea.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EU should step up efforts to solidify the deal, in turn stopping President Erdogan from gaining control of Turkmenistan.Nevertheless, current President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, like his predecessor, Niyazov, is unpredictable and hard to be trusted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turkmenistan is under a totalitarian regime and that is not going to change in the near future.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
