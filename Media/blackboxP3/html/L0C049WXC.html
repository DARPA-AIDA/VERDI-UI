'</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used to buy this stuff for $30.Now it's $60,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' he said.'And recall that Biden himself publicly predicted just before his 'inauguration' in mid January, '</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the darkest days are ahead for America</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'.What a grim difference with a bright future offered by President Trump's MAGA policies advancement to Keep America Safe and Secure, Prosperous and UNITED, and Great for years to come.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-13T14:04:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

raise taxes on U.S. businesses [like they will not pass the increase onto consumers] and lower the taxes on China.This is another example of the DNC’s loyalty to China over the U.S. People.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-13T12:01:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Troy Dynes</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biden doesn't know how jobs work in

small business owners don't even pay themselves yet and are now confronted with gut wrenching taxes and significan't wage increases.The only option is to lean out the costs, fire some people, and pray you survive.Many won't though and will just fold instantly.What a disaster.Have these guys taken econ 101 yet?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

Congress and Senate have no idea what it takes to run a profitable business.Every man jack of them would bankrupt a business in a very short time.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

corrupt local and state government employees and elected officials; same as 'infrastructure' spending at National and state/local Levels was over-promised for up front cash to individuals/organizations.When Biden promised $100 Trillion in Infrastructure/spending - that was the amount he/Dems promised would be handed over to China/foreign investors Dems are privately in debt to; to keep those debt collectors from coming after them personally.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there isn't enough money to hand over $100 Trillion in infrastructure projects quick enough, the other deals.... real estate to private businesses are part of the $100 Trillion promised ...China.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infrastructure is defined as: The basic facilities, services, and installations needed for the functioning of a community or society, such as roads and communications systems, water and power lines, and public institutions including schools, post offices, and prisons.Under Biden: Infrastructure has already been expanded to include food and its delivery (Covid restrictions), art and entertainment, homes/housing and every other available scam they could sell government contracts to 'investors' to alleviate their own private debts being called.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not intending to be mean toward the Senator, but: Senator Wicker and the others (understand they are trying, but not efficiently...) are talking down the problems Biden/Dems created.It's not a 'job killer' to hike taxes on small businesses; it's a way to put them out of business so the Dems' foreign investors can take those jobs over too.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell the truth about why Biden/Dems are giving the country away; people need to hear what's behind all of the insane efforts Biden/Dems are confronting the country with currently.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-13T16:14:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
