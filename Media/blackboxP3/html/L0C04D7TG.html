Schulz, is the world’s sixth largest character brand by retail sales.In Q3, the Peanuts brand contributed to the signing of 85 new deals for DHX Media as well as 70 renewals with companies like Lands End, Baskin Robbins, and Tupperware.In addition, Levi’s is currently launching its second collaboration with Peanuts with an expanded line of products that will be available around the globe.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About DHX Media</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DHX Media Ltd.(TSX: DHX; NASDAQ: DHXM) is a global children’s content and brands company, recognized for such high-profile properties as</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peanuts</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teletubbies</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strawberry Shortcake</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caillou</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspector Gadget</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, and the acclaimed</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degrassi</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;franchise.One of the world’s foremost producers of children’s shows, DHX Media owns the world’s largest independent library of children’s content, at 13,000 half-hours.It licenses its content to broadcasters and streaming services worldwide and generates royalties through its global consumer products program.Through its subsidiary, WildBrain, DHX Media operates one of the largest networks of children’s channels on YouTube.Headquartered in Canada, DHX Media has offices worldwide.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convertible Feature</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DHX Media’s 2024 bonds are convertible, meaning that these bonds can be converted to DHX Media common stock at a conversion price of $8 per share.DHX can redeem the notes anytime after September 30, 2020 if the stock’s current market price is 135% of the conversion price.This would mean the share price would need to be $10.80 / share.Also important for bondholders to know, the company has the right to repay the principal of these notes by issuing common stock using a share price that is 95% of the stock’s current price on the redemption date.Over the past year, DHX Media stock has ranged from a low of $1.09 to a high of $3.69.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WildBrain</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WildBrain, a wholly owned subsidiary of DHX Media, operates one of the largest networks of children’s channels on YouTube.Growth for this ad-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) service is one of the DHX Media’s top priorities, and WildBrain has been performing well.The core asset of WildBrain is its large and growing audience.In Q3, views on WildBrain increased by 15% to more than 8.7 billion and watch times grew by 9%.One in three kids worldwide with access to YouTube watch videos on WildBrain each quarter.The following graphic shows WildBrain’s growth over the past few years.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Source: DHX Media Q3 FY2019 Investor Presentation)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Developments</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DHX Media has locked down additional engagements that should give additional visibility to its brands as well as increase revenues.First, the company announced a deal with Apple in late 2018 to produce Peanuts content for Apple’s upcoming streaming service.DHX will develop and produce original series, specials and shorts that feature the Peanuts group of characters created by Charles M. Schulz.Apple’s streaming service should launch in the second half of 2019.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the deal with Apple, DHX recently announced that it had closed a deal with Comcast to debut a brand new children’s subscription based video-on-demand service called Kids Room.The service will launch in the summer of 2019 and will be an ad-free service with kid-friendly programs sourced from DHX Media’s library of content.The service will be available on Comcast’s Xfinity X1 as well as Xfinity Flex.Customers can add Kids Room to their service for $4.99 per month.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest Coverage and Liquidity</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest coverage is an indication to bondholders of an issuer’s ability to service its existing level of debt.DHX Media’s most recent quarterly results indicate operating income of $25.3 million (loss before taxes of -$19.1 million, adding back $10.2 million in interest expense and $34.2 million non-cash impairment charge), with interest expense of $10.2 million.This calculates to an interest coverage of 2.5x.In terms of liquidity, DHX had cash on hand as of March 31, 2019 of $42.4 million.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign up to receive updates on DHX Media bonds, Free Leading Financial News, Market research, much more!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[qcf]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk for bondholders is whether DHX Media can continue to build on the momentum it has produced over the last few quarters.The company’s most recent numbers have not been their best performance as many of their financial metrics did not register increases over last year.Changes in the YouTube platform along with issues related to the YouTube Kids app has provided some challenges in viewing content for customers, but DHX Media’s CEO Michael Donovan emphatically believes that 'AVOD is the future of television' and that DHX Media is 'the number one leader in the family and children’s space by several miles and accelerating.'With kids viewing hours increasing he may be on to something.At any rate, the outstanding yield-to-maturity of over 12.5% on these convertible 2024 bonds does appear to outweigh the risks identified.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa.This effect tends to be more pronounced for lower couponed, longer-term debt instruments.Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a gain or loss.Higher yielding bonds typically have lower credit ratings, if any, and therefore involve higher degrees of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary and Conclusion</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DHX Media owns the rights to some of children’s most beloved characters; Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Teletubbies, Caillou, Super Mario and Inspector Gadget.The company is a leader in its ownership, production and distribution of children’s content in both more traditional TV markets and certainly in the streaming space (YouTube).The company’s 2024 convertible bonds are currently trading at a significant discount, giving them an outstanding yield to maturity of about 12.75%, making these competitive yielding notes make an ideal addition to Durig Capital’s Fixed Income 2 (FX2) High Yield Managed Income Portfolio, shown above.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issuer: DHX Media Ticker: (TSX: DHX;
