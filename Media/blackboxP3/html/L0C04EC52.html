term extension for the National Assembly beyond 2020.The opposition-held National Assembly is headed by opposition leader Juan Guaido.A collective of major western powers, including the United States and the United Kingdom, recognize him as the country’s legitimate leader.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Assembly has posed numerous threats to Maduro’s leadership in the past two

able to stay in power largely due to the military’s support.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest legislative move is no doubt a thorn in the flesh for members of Maduro’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela, who won seats in the National Assembly largely unopposed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the recent election results, Maduro’s party won 67 percent of the seats in the National Assembly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victory was largely due to lowered competition after Guaido instructed his followers as well as party candidates to refrain from participating in the polls because they were fraudulent.Consequently, a majority of members of the country’s four principal parties that make up the opposition didn’t take part.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term extension paves the way for Guaido to remain in charge, although lawmakers are looking to put more checks on his power.The National Assembly is tasked with passing laws and approving the national budget.It has, however, posed numerous threats to Maduro’s leadership in the past two years.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To counter its power, Maduro created the National Constituent Assembly in 2017.The government body is made up of his crusaders.Ultimately, the National Constituent Assembly sidelined the opposition-controlled National Assembly in decision-making.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the recent electoral triumph, new Maduro loyalists were expected to be sworn in to the National Assembly on January 5, 2021, but the unexpected term extension by incumbent members has thrown a spanner in the works.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Murky Situation</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States supports opposition leader Juan Guaido.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The move by Guaido and his party members to block a takeover of the National Assembly puts Maduro in an awkward position.He is not in a favorable position to forcefully take over the house due to the powerful countries backing the opposition leader.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States, which is Guaido’s biggest foreign backer, has already issued sanctions against two entities and a private company for allegedly providing material support to the Venezuelan administration during the elections.Maduro has dismissed the allegation as injudicious.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company, Ex-Cle Soluciones Biometricas CA, which is a biometrics firm, was among those accused.The unveiled sanctions block any assets tied to the firm in the US.They also prohibit American entities from transacting with it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a statement provided by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin:</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The illegitimate Maduro regime’s efforts to steal elections in Venezuela show its disregard for the democratic aspirations of the Venezuelan people.The United States remains committed to targeting the Maduro regime and those who support its aim to deny the Venezuelan people their right to free and fair elections.'</blockquote></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow
