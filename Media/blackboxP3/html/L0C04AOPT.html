for those experiencing mild to moderate symptoms (fever, cough, muscle aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills, fatigue, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea); or for those who have a known or suspected exposure.A provider order is highly recommended, however, Memorial Healthcare is prepared to assist with an order if needed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memorial Healthcare averages a little over 24 hours for testing turnaround.To view our current testing turnaround times via the State of Michigan, click here.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share:</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-11-09T00:00:00<br></p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04AOPW.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04AOPX.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04AOPV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-11-09</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-21</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04AOPT</p></body></html>
