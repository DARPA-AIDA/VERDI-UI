people interested in your brand or product.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits Of Social Media Advertising</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plenty of ways to advertise: magazines, YouTube, or even a TV commercial.But the most effective way to bring in business is by reaching out to the right group of people.For example, advertising a kid’s toy in a beauty magazine won’t sell the product.You have to advertise on social media so that people with kids will see this toy and want to buy it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More people use social media than reading magazines or watching TV, so it’s critical to

the pros and cons of each?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facebook</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros:</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are millions of people of various ages on Facebook.Advertisements here can reach almost anyone appearing on the user’s timeline, or on the side of the screen where it’s subtle but still visible.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons:</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subtle ads, might not attract the business you want.While millions use the platform, not many use it all day.Users check notifications, catch up on the news, and then log off.Since there are numerous ads on Facebook, eye-catching information is critical.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twitter</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros:</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as many people use Twitter as Facebook.However, a younger generation of people uses Twitter, leading to potential new business contacts and with new interests.Twitter uses hashtags to promote current trends.Use this trending information to your advantage to get people to look at what you’re selling.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons:</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being up to date on current trends, including your brand, will attract attention.If your business is not reflecting current trends, it will lose customers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instagram</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can choose a paid post to appear on someone’s timeline or advertise through the story section of the platform.People use this app constantly, possibly more than Facebook and Twitter.People of all ages use it, so you can choose the target audience.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons:</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few disadvantages to using Instagram other than someone skipping through an ad to avoid watching Instagram stories or if they are mindlessly scrolling their feed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LinkedIn</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who use LinkedIn tend to be more serious and business-oriented.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons:</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It limits the target audience to those who are older.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few disadvantages to using Instagram other than someone skipping through an ad to avoid watching Instagram stories or if they are mindlessly

exposure.People look for something funny to send to their friends: your filter and ad placement may be the one sent.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons:</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your filter must be picture-worthy, that is, unique and stands out compared to other filters.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinterest</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros:</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users are looking for interesting and fun pictures.If they like your ad, they pin it to their board where others will see it.</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons:</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pictures need to be eye-catching and original.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takeaway</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose the platform that best suits what you are selling.For a more mature, more serious audience, Facebook or LinkedIn may be more appropriate.For a younger audience, Snapchat and Instagram may be a better fit.Creating ads can be difficult, but companies are there to help, such as Colibri Digital Marketing.Once you have chosen the site you want to invest in, look for digital marketing companies who specialize in social media to create the ideal for your business.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
