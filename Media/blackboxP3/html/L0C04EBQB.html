President Nicolas Maduro to leave office in order to liberate his nation from the devastating sanctions imposed by the US.The US official said this while visiting Guyana.According to Pompeo, Maduro was preventing economic progress in his nation by holding on to power.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maduro has accused the United States government of sending spies and paid mercenaries to oust

Venezuela and an end to the illegitimate regime that is denying that very democracy that the Guyanese people so love, denying that democracy from the people of Venezuela,' he said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His visit to Guyana is to help strengthen commercial ties between the US and the small South American nation.It was recently discovered that the country was sitting on over 8 billion barrels of oil.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finding has caused a bit of a stir as more nations seek to strike oil supply deals.Maduro has hit back at Pompeo’s remarks and said that the United States is getting desperate in its attempts to usurp him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mike Pompeo is on a war-mongering tour against Venezuela, but it has backfired on him . ..and he has failed in all his attempts to get the governments of the continent to organize themselves in a war against Venezuela,' he said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maduro has accused the United States government of sending spies and paid mercenaries to oust him from power.Just last week, he announced the capture of a US spy in his country.The former Green Beret was caught alongside three other individuals.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Venezuelan state media, the man, Matthew John Heath, was found with specialized weaponry that included a grenade launcher and a satellite phone.He was apparently planning to sabotage the Amuay and Cardon oil refineries.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trump administration has strived to wield its economic might to put 'maximum pressure' on its foes.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All the evidence is there, the photographs, the videos, this spy is a marine, who was serving as a marine at CIA bases in Iraq,' Maduro said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Elliott Abrams, the US special envoy to Venezuela, the US government had no involvement in the alleged sabotage plot.'From everything I’ve seen, I can say the United States government did not send Mr Heath to Venezuela,' he said</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trump administration has strived to wield its economic might to put 'maximum pressure' on its foes.It has relied heavily on embargos and prohibitions to undermine the leadership of nations that are unyielding to its agendas.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategy has, however, only served to rattle some of America’s main archenemies.The Iranian leadership, for example, remains averse to foreign interference from America.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Trump administration had targeted Maduro’s inner circle, while implementing sanctions, the strategy has only led to the impoverishment of millions of Venezuelan citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, is additionally still entrenched in power and is showing no signs of relinquishing it anytime soon.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook
