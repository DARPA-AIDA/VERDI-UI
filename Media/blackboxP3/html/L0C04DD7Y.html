open distribution– licenses do not any any way restrict any party from selling or giving away even a component of any software.And there is no royalty or other such fees.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tumblr (stylized as tumblr and pronounced 'tumbler') is a microblogging and social networking website founded by David Karp in 2007 and currently owned by Automattic.The service allows users to post multimedia and other content to a short-form blog.Users can follow other users’ blogs.Bloggers can also make their blogs private.For bloggers many of the website’s features are accessed from a 'dashboard' interface.As of August 12, 2019, Tumblr hosts over 475 million blogs.As of January 2016, the website had over 500 million monthly visitors] which dropped to less than 400 million by August 2019</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WordPress is acquiring Tumblr, '</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the Web’s most iconic brands.It is an essential venue to share new ideas, cultures and experiences, helping millions create and build communities around their shared interests.WordPress is excited to add Tumble clients to the wordpress successful products and services as WooCommerce, Jetpack, Simplenote, Longreads, and more</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,' According to Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg (Automattic is the parent of WordPress).This new integration with Tumblr will require millions of additional lines of code and thus this becomes a beautiful marketplace for a low price gig market to thrive.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WordPress structure always includes source code– the distribution of source code as well as in compiled form.This makes a specialized expert in the WP source code very valuable in freelance gig marketplaces, helping to apply specialized source code to websites that are already built our and often heavily utilized.The WP license allows modifications and derived works, but they require it all to be available for distribution under the same terms as the license of the original software.All of this WordPress and Tumblr integration requires a very large number of experts to solve these issues and FGG Low Cost Marketplace wants to connect the world, linking code experts with existing website owners to exchange services within the WP ecosystem.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At FGG Low Cost Marketplace we have integrated with Communal’s robust news, market research and blog readership–proving hundreds of thousands of potential clients for the gig marketplace.We have grown over 300% in the last three month in visitors and are close to 1 million annual viewers.With our high volume of business readers, we believe FGG Low Cost Marketplace could become one of the most robust gig markets for the WordPress and Tumblr markets (each separately and including their integration).FGG Low Cost Marketplace hopes to leverage news events, such as this WordPress purchase of Tumblr and the vast dislocation of websites this purchase creates, to increase opportunities for our gig vendors.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</li><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2019-08-27T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Freelance Global
