Security Council members in New York, diplomats said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be the first public discussion of Myanmar by the Council’s members since the coup on Feb.1.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Council has condemned the violence against protesters, but has not defined the military takeover as a coup or threatened any action, due to opposition by China, Russia, India and Vietnam.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States, which has imposed sanctions on the junta’s economic interests, on Thursday added a state-owned gem enterprise to its list of targets.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The junta has not baulked at taking on celebrities, and on Thursday arrested Paing Takhon, a popular 24-year-old model and actor who had spoken out against the coup and pledged support for Aung San Suu Kyi, his sister Thi Thi Lwin said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said eight trucks and about 50 soldiers had come to pick him up at their parents’ home in Yangon, where he had been staying as he was unwell from malaria and a heart condition.She did not know where he had been taken.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAPP has said over 2,800 people are in detention for opposing the junta.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Myanmar’s leading champion of democracy over three decades, has been held at an undisclosed location since the coup and charged with crimes that could see her jailed and banned from politics.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her National League for Democracy won an election in November but the military – which has ruled Burma for most of its post-independence history – alleged that it had been marred by fraud.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The junta’s vice-chairman, Soe Win, was shown on state-run television meeting with military officers in Shan state to detail what he said were more cases of fraud.Many Western governments have dismissed the assertions as nonsense.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLACKLISTED GEMS</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States, the European Union and others have already imposed sanctions on generals involved in the coup and some of their family members, as well as two conglomerates controlled by the military.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest U.S. sanctions blacklisted Myanma Gems Enterprise, part of the mining ministry.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The move blocks Americans from doing business with the entity, which issues permits and licences to mine precious stones and collects revenues from the sale of gems and jade.The U.S. Treasury Department said it would curb the junta’s ability to generate revenues.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myanmar is the world’s main source of jade, and a major source of rubies and other rare gems.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States would 'keep increasing pressure on the regime’s revenue streams until it ceases its violence, releases all those unjustly detained, lifts martial law and the nationwide state of emergency, removes telecommunications restrictions, and restores Burma to the path of democracy'.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An adviser to the CRPH told Reuters that at least six lawmakers from the National League for Democracy were now sheltering in India.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Indian police official said they were among about 1,800 people who had entered from Myanmar since late February.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'MPs are in great danger at the moment in Myanmar.They are being searched, they are being followed by the soldiers,' the adviser said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Reporting by Reuters Staff; Writing by Angus MacSwan; Editing by Kevin Liffey)</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-08T21:14:56<br></p></p><p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04AAF4.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04AAF3.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-08</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-17</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04AAEO</p></body></html>
