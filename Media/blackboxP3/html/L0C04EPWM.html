they’re at one percent, not two percent,' he told reporters outside the White House on Wednesday.'They’ve taken advantage of us for many years.'Trump added he may rethink the decision 'if they start paying their bills.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secretary Esper also echoed President Trump’s statement, saying that Germany was a 'rich country,' and should spend more on its defense.The German government says it plans to spend 13.7% of its GDP on defense in 2020.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Esper is the 27th and current United States secretary of defense, and a former U.S. Army officer and defense contractor lobbyist.He previously served as the 23rd United States secretary of the Army from 2017 to 2019.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Burden' on Bilateral Relations</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired US General Ben Hodges, meanwhile, told reporters that the decision to relocate US troops was fundamentally wrong.'America’s most important ally in Europe is Germany.And the withdrawal of US troops would be a 'gift to the Kremlin.'It would reduce US capacity in Europe without taking action against Russian aggression.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bavarian Minister-President Markus Söder also criticized the US plan to withdraw troops, saying it would not serve a clear military purpose, and would weaken the NATO alliance and the United States itself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Unfortunately, this is German,' said Söder.'It will be a burden on US relations,' he said.'We will see how long this decision lasts,' referring to the US presidential election in November.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaders of four German states are thought to have called on the US Congress to halt troop reductions, warning that it could weaken the Atlantic alliance against Moscow.In addition, several members of President Trump’s own party also criticized the decision to withdraw troops from Germany.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-30T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Benedict Kasigara</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y3.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04EPWR.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04EPWU.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04EPWV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495XV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495XW.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495YA.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495XU.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y8.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495Y0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C0495Y2.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495YE.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495Y7.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-07-30</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-07-09</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04EPWM</p></body></html>
