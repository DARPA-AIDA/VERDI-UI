Hitler.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comes at a time when neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine, some of which have received direct support from the Ukrainian government, are terrorizing ethnic minorities from the Roma and Jewish communities.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ukraine’s billionaire oligarch President Petro Poroshenko, who is known as the 'Chocolate King' due to his time in the confectionery industry, has campaigned for Kyiv to join NATO.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since coming to power in 2014, the pro-Western Ukrainian leader has been advised by Yuri Biryukov, an extreme-right nationalist who also advises Ukraine’s defense minister.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ukraine’s Glavred Media reported that Biryukov posted a neo-Nazi slogan on his personal Facebook page, where he has nearly 150,000 followers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biryukov wrote the Nazi symbol '1.4.8.8.'The latter half of this symbol, 88, is code for 'Heil Hitler' (with H being the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet).The former half is a reference to the white supremacist slogan known as the '14 Words' ('We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children').</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biryukov later deleted this Facebook post, but only after Ukrainian journalist Anatoly Shariy captured a screenshot of it.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Facebook post in which Yuri Biryukov, an adviser

democratically elected pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, the new President Petro Poroshenko has pushed for closer relations with the West.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this time period, the Ukrainian government has become increasingly infiltrated by fascists and right-wing extremists, who have used Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the pro-Russian separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine to garner support from the United States and European allies.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max Blumenthal has reported at The Real News Network on how the U.S. has armed and assisted neo-Nazis in Ukraine, and how the fascist chairman of Ukraine’s parliament, Andriy Parubiy, was welcomed in the U.S. Congress.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ukrainian government itself has also directly funded neo-Nazi groups.The far-right political party Svoboda and fascist militia C14 were awarded grants from Ukraine’s Ministry of Youth and Sport, for 'national-patriotic education projects.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C14, which is notorious for carrying out terror attacks on Roma, Jews, and LGBTQ Ukrainians, is named after the same white supremacist '14 Words' cited by the president’s adviser Biryukov.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2018-07-09T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Ben Norton</p></p><p><p><img
