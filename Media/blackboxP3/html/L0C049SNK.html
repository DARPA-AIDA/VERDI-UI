businesses are in bad shape.He has a $320 Million dollar loan that he personally guaranteed that comes due next year and he does not have the money, which means he will want you people to continue giving him money, with the reason being that he may run again.He is in trouble financially and he is using everyone who is a trump sheeple to fund him through the mess he has made of his organization.Otherwise, he would need to liquidate most all of his holdings.On top of it, no bank in the world will have anything to do with Trump.His followers are now his banker.He is not using that money for politics.He is using that money for personal gain.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, trump wants you to believe he has the ability to run, and win again, which he doesn't.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-13T14:47:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Jk599</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you know he is in trouble

Wall Street were not good for consumers (all of us) and was letting them off of paying their fair share and that is good for all of us.All of the agencies' abilities to investigate and enforce abusive practices by Wall Street was hampered by Trump's rules.This will not affect earnings and will not affect retirement plans but will greatly help the consumer.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wall Street may be a necessary evil but why in the world would you want Wall Street to increase their share of wealth in this country when they already control and own almost 80% of the revenue stream and/or wealth.Why would you want them to continue with their abusive practices with little accountability?This is a good thing for the little guy in this country.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
