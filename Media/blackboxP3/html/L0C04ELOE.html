Market</title></head><body><h1>US Healthcare, Electronics, Aerospace industries to Drive Growth of the North America Polyarylsulfone Market</h1><p>US Healthcare, Electronics, Aerospace industries to Drive Growth of the North America Polyarylsulfone Market</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global polyarylsulfone market is segmented into automotive, healthcare, aerospace, water treatment, electrical electronics, and others.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe is also expected to show steady demand for polyarylsulfone due to strong automotive market and growing microelectronics market in Germany.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the healthcare industry, polyarylsulfone is widely used to manufacture various instruments such as X-ray machines, gamma machines, dental and surgical equipment, orthopedic equipment, and sterilization trays.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global Polyarylsulfone Market is segmented by product type, end-user industry, and region.Polyarylsulfone (PAS) is amorphous high-performance thermoplastics containing phenyl and biphenyl groups linked by ether and sulfone groups.It offers more thermal resistance and superior short and long-term thermal stability than engineered thermoplastics.It can withstand long-term service temperature of up to 1500C and short-term temperature of 2500C.It offers several other desirable characteristics such as high impact tensile strength, lightweight, excellent transparency, low moisture absorption, good dimensional stability, good flame retardancy, high glass transition temperature (2000C), low coefficient of thermal expansion (1200C), and good hot water, steam, chemical, and stress cracking resistance.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the major players operating in the global polyarylsulfone market are Solvay SA (Belgium), BASF SE (Germany), Sumitomo Chemical Company.(Japan), SABIC (Saudi Arabia), Quadrant Plastic Composites AG (Switzerland), Polymer Industries (U.S.), Westlake Plastics Company (U.S.), Polymer Dynamix Llc (U.S.), Ensinger Inc.(U.S.), and RTP Company (U.S.).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the product type, the global polyarylsulfone market is segmented into polysulfone (PSU), polyethersulfone (PESU), and polyphenylsulfone (PPSU).Based on the end-user industry, the global polyarylsulfone market is segmented into automotive, healthcare, aerospace, water treatment, electrical electronics, and others.Based on the region, the global polyarylsulfone market is segmented into Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East Africa.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Global Polyarylsulfone Market is segmented into five regions namely Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa.The Middle East Africa market is expected to show rising demand for polyarylsulfone over the forecast period.However, the demand is relatively stagnant compared to other regions.Europe is also expected to show steady demand for polyarylsulfone due to strong automotive market and growing microelectronics market in Germany.North America is one of the major markets for polyarylsulfone and is expected to show a steady demand during the forecast period 2017-2023.Growing healthcare industry, electronics industry, and aerospace industry in the U.S. is expected to drive the growth of the North America polyarylsulfone market.Latin America is expected to show moderate demand for polyarylsulfone due to its water treatment application over the forecast period.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the healthcare industry, polyarylsulfone is widely used to manufacture various instruments such as X-ray machines, gamma machines, dental and surgical equipment, orthopedic equipment, and sterilization trays.These applications are expected to be the major contributor to the growth of polyarylsulfone market over the assessment period.The growing trend of replacing the metal parts with lightweight polymers in the automotive and aerospace industries to increase the fuel efficiency is expected to boost the growth of the polyarylsulfone to a large extent during the forecast period.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browse
