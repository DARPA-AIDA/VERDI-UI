forces of pushing China-US relations into a 'new cold war.'At a press conference on Sunday, Wang accused the U.S. of 'wasting time,' and of 'wishful thinking.'</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang

style='max-width: 480px;'/></p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Regretfully, in addition to the raging coronavirus, a political virus is also spreading in the United States.This political virus is using every opportunity to attack and smear China,' said Wang, who is also China’s foreign minister.The Foreign Minister’s Press Conference is a 'fixed program' of the 'two sessions' each year.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In nearly 90 minutes, Wang Yi answered 23 questions from Chinese and international media, many of which focused on China-US relations.On the issue of Hong Kong, Wang once again criticized external forces for 'intervention' in Hong Kong affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the press conference, Hong Kong is erupting the largest protest since the start of the new coronavirus epidemic.Thousands of people took to the streets to protest Beijing’s sudden announcement of Hong Kong’s 'National Security Law' legislative plan.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accuses the US of 'Political Viruses'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the press conference held via online video due to the New Coronavirus epidemic, the China-US relationship was undoubtedly the most concerned by the outside world.In many of his answers, Wang launched a fierce attack on the United States.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked about the polls that showed that the American people’s favorability with China has reached a new low, China and the United States may accelerate their decoupling, and how China will face it, Wang responded in kind.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Some politicians have ignored the most basic facts and concocted too many lies about China and plotted too many conspiracies,' he said.'I want to say here: Don’t waste precious time any longer, and don’t ignore lives,' Wang added.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade war is not over, and the new coronavirus epidemic has accelerated the deterioration of relations between the United States and China.As of April of this year, there have been at least seven lawsuits in the US for the epidemic, including the Missouri state government.These lawsuits allege that China is suspected of taking intentional actions or neglecting their duties, leading to the spread of the new coronavirus epidemic.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang Yi responded at the press conference that these lawsuits 'have no factual basis, no legal basis, and no international precedent,' and said that China is also a 'victim' of the pandemic.In another question, he further accused some American political forces of 'abducting China-US relations' during the pandemic, trying to push China-US relations to a 'new cold war.'He stated that this will bury the achievements of China-US cooperation for many years.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China, normally referred to as the National People’s Congress (usually abbreviated NPC), is the highest organ of state power and the national legislature of the People’s Republic of China.Western media sources commonly describe the NPC as a de facto rubber stamping body although at the turn of the century some academics asserted that the NPC had then begun to emerge as an influential force in Chinese politics.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'China has no intention to change the United States, and the United States cannot change China wishfully,' he said.Every year, in addition to the press conference of the premier, the 'two sessions' of China includes the foreign ministers’ press conferences.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Chinese authorities reduced the duration of the meeting due to the epidemic situation, and a considerable number of meeting schedules have been reduced.Only four press conferences have been retained.The Foreign Minister’s press conference is one of them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the press conference has undergone great changes in form.The press conference held at the Media Center in Beijing in previous years was conducted through online videoconferencing this year, just like a 'cloud press conference.'The reporters are still in the huge auditorium of the news center, but they face three huge screens.At the other end of the screen; there are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials in the Great Hall of the People.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if the reporters just go to the news center, they must do nucleic acid detection in the morning.Only after waiting for a few hours for the results to come out, and then go to the venue.Despite spending a lot of time, the response was quite satisfactory.All questions are arranged in advance, and cover issues like the United States, Russia, the European Union, Africa, Japan, South Korea, and ASEAN countries.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heightened
