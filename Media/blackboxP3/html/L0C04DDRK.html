however, when it becomes so strong and punchy, it could, after all, be a signal that you have an infection.A vaginal infection could ensue thanks to excess bacteria as well as an unbalanced pH.In such a case, one might experience a greenish discharge in case a sexually transmitted disease has attacked them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Burning Sensation when urinating</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sign that you are suffering from a urinary infection such as cystitis.Other symptoms are:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperious and constant need to urinate Frequent urination in small quantities Blood in the urine Cloudy urine with a strong smell Pelvic discomfort A sensation of pressure in the lower abdomen</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Vaginal dryness</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaginal dryness mostly affects elderly women who are in their menopause stages; however, as a young lady, you are not immune to it either because it can also be caused by the use of fragrant soaps, vaginal showers, towels or tampons and even the detergent with which you wash your panties.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.Vaginal Itchiness</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasional vagina itchiness is usually nothing to worry about.However, if the itching is so frequent and annoying that it hinders you in your day to day activities, then it is time to do something about it.Itching is a result of irritation.Therefore, check whether you have recently had unprotected sex or used a new detergent for your underwear.It may equally be a signal that you have an STD or you could be experiencing an allergy.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psoriasis is a long-lasting autoimmune disease characterized by patches of abnormal skin.These skin patches are typically red, dry, itchy, and scaly.On people with darker skin the patches may be purple in color.Psoriasis varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage.Injury to the skin can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which is known as the Koebner phenomenon.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some common causes of an itchy vagina are:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pubic lice</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genital Warts</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herpes genitalis</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trichomonas</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vaginal fungal infection</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacterial vaginosis</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scabies</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psoriasis</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eczema</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichen Sclerosis</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.Bleeding after sex</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, we aren’t referring to menstrual blood, but we are talking about the blood that you see after sex.Some of the causes of that are the use of contraceptives that create mismatches, or in extreme cases, it could equally be a sign of ovarian cancer.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.Pain during sex</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clitoris is the organ of pleasure par excellence because being stimulated triggers an orgasmic response in a matter of minutes.The bad thing is when your partner stimulates it through oral sex, use of fingers or vibrators, and you instead end up feeling pain.In case of such, visit your doctor immediately so that the problem gets detected and solved.Leading a healthy intimate life is necessary for your personal and sexual comfort.So, Women always listen to your Vaginas.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2019-08-24T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Susan Simpsons</p></p><p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04DDRS.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y3.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04DDRZ.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C04DDS0.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C04DDRR.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495XV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495XW.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495YA.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495XU.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y8.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495YI.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495Y0.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../png/L0C0495Y2.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495YE.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495Y7.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2019-08-24</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-07-08</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04DDRK</p></body></html>
