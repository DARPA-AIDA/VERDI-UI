veiled threat to move navy vessels to Gulf of Mexico</h1><p>China issues veiled threat to move navy vessels to Gulf of Mexico</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joey Biden, talking about St.Barack:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Remember, I said it standing here, if you don't remember anything else I said.Watch, we're going to have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oct.20, 2008</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our advisories know that the U.S. has an Incompetent-in-Chief and will exploit it.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

1600 Pennsylvania Ave.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>billwheeler89</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'real' enemy that made Joe who is today is not Washington D.C., it's the TV, radio, and news magazines owned by a handful of media moguls that are doing a great disservice to our country by using CCP propaganda on us.The real enemy to our Republic are all those wonderful newscaster celebrities we think we trust....whose only job is reading a teleprompter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add most of the major celebrities in Hollywood too that publically endorses the Left's agenda.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 'tools' have the most impact at nefariously influencing people's minds.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we're out on the streets protesting against each other, what Americans should be doing is surrounding and protesting all the TV and radio broadcast studios in their cities that house all these newscasters and news reporters doing live broadcasting.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Brat Boy</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you are right.But media is just an organ for bigger fish like the banksters, UN, WEF, ChiComs, MIC, Soros, et al.This last election was like the Congo or Nicaragua.What is to be done?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-11T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Kat</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree... however,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever coin that term 'the revolution will not be televised' already knew 'back then' that a nefarious propaganda campaign has already taken over United States politics, we unfortunately just didn't see the deeper meaning behind it, and we let it persist without confronting it head on.Therefore we have no idea what would happen if we did because we continue to just standby and ignore the media as 'the messengers, the voice' of the oligarchy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't have to be a Trump Supporter or any other political affiliation to be concern that we can't trust western news, they don't care about American values and won't stop until we turn our protesting on them.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
