primarily made up of Ascorbic acid, is one of the most essential and useful nutrients required by our body to maintain good health and ensure the proper functioning of several body parts.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being an antioxidant, it plays a pivotal role by enabling the production of collagen, an enzyme necessary for developing anti-aging chemicals.Regardless of gender or anatomy, Vitamin C helps form nutrients that are integral for skincare, development of hair, and other beauty-enhancing features.Vitamin C supplements are helpful in fulfilling their daily requirement for healthy hair and skin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting toxic oxygen-based metabolism products</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a great and formulated antioxidant, Vitamin C can greatly help in neutralizing toxic and depleting byproducts of oxygen metabolism, which accumulate over the surface of the skin.These chemicals known as free radicals in medical parlance settle over the surface of the skin and start destroying the free skin cells.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the skin turns pale due to the presence of such free radicals.Vitamin C can help in cleansing the skin of such free radicals by destroying them as Vitamin C reacts with them and converts them into soluble byproducts.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protection against UV rays.</figcaption><p><img

the skin cells to a high degree, leading to skin burns and even loss of pigmentation.AOR Vitamin C acts as a natural defense against the UV rays and keeps the skin shielded from the UV raysâ€™ harmful effects.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It helps in the production of collagen, a protein that reduces the effects of ultraviolet rays to a great extent.Vitamin C is probably the only defense against the UV induced photodamage and even photoaging.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing wrinkles and dry skin</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advent of the busy work schedule, hectic life cycle, hustling in crowded places, skin problems like wrinkles and dry skin have become common in people of all ages.It has also led to faster aging of the skin due to the sagging of skin cells.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome this, Vitamin C is the best panacea.Being an antioxidant and having protein supplementing chemicals helps develop skin proteins, helping to reduce wrinkles and dryness of the skin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curing hyper/ under pigmentation</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pigmentation refers to the color, texture, and tonality of the skin.With time, the skin starts losing its natural pigmentation.In some cases, dark patches and dark circles start appearing due to medical issues or lifestyle choices, leading to a loss in pigmentation.Hence the skin starts looking darker and blemished in most cases.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is due to the enzyme tyrosinase, which chemically inhibits the production of melanin.Melanin is the chemical that helps in maintaining the natural pigmentation of the skin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence natural factors Vitamin C helps to stop the production of the enzyme tyrosinase.This helps in restoring the melanin composition in the skin, thus restoring the natural pigmentation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repairs brittle/split hair</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the common problems of having long hair is the development of split hairs, which leads to hair fall.Moreover, if not looked after properly, the hair becomes brittle, leading to irritation and allergic tendencies.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is again in part due to the free radicals which are created due to pollution.Vitamin C helps replenish the skin with the right proteins and develops a sheath to fight off the free radicals.Thus it not only reduces hair fall but also makes the hair stronger.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removing dandruff and flaky scalps.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removing dandruff and flaky scalps</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dandruff leads to hair problems and clogs our sweat pores, which may lead to severe medical issues.Over the period, the accumulation of dandruff becomes so pronounced that they start entering into the skin layers, thus accentuating the problems.For such cases, Vitamin C, given its mild acidic properties, helps in dissolving dandruff.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clears the skin pores and ensures that the skin is light and free from any external agent.Most skin specialists recommend using Vitamin C in various forms to fight dandruff and remove dead skin cells.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiding hair growth</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hair shedding is one of the common issues among people from all walks of life.If the hair growth is unable to keep pace with hair shedding, then it leads to loss of hair and reduces the facial and physical appeal of an individual.Vitamin C helps in speeding up the formation of new hair.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitamin C is a blend of acidic, antioxidant, and protein-producing agents that is imperative for having healthy skin and hair.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that it has no clinically proven side effects makes its use all the more compelling and risk-free.Today the medical fraternity highly recommends the use of Vitamin C in various forms to slow down aging, develop new cells, weed out unwanted tissues and scalps.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to bring hand sanitizer or other sanitation supplies to not only keep your hands clean, but also to wipe down equipment before you use it.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still important to be mindful of your distance from other patrons and always keep distance from anyone not in your household.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexibility here is key to helping you still get a meaningful workout when your original plan is no longer possible.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gyms and fitness centers across the United States are beginning to reopen after their widespread closure due to the COVID-19 outbreak.Each location is instituting precautions and requirements to ensure the safety of patrons and employees alike.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond following any requirements from your fitness center, here are five tips to keep in mind when returning to your gym routine.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Prepare before you go</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, packing a gym bag may have just meant including a towel, change of clothes, and a water bottle (which is even more important now that many states have required businesses to turn off public water fountains).However, there are a few more essentials to keep in your gym bag.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, of course, is a face mask or other covering.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend cloth masks as they do not overly restrict air flow but still provide adequate protection against airborne pathogens.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, be sure to bring hand sanitizer or other sanitation supplies to not only keep your hands clean, but also to wipe down equipment before you use it.Many gyms and fitness centers will provide santiation supplies, but it is still best to bring your own incase access is limited or supplies are low.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, even if your gym does provide a towel service, it is recommended to bring your own towels as you can be more certain of their cleaniness.Be mindful of where you place it as well, especially if you use it to wipe your face or hands.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Maintain social distance</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, most gyms are required to physically distance their machines and other equipment so that users are at least six feet apart.However, it is still important to be mindful of your distance from other patrons and always keep distance from anyone not in your household.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a routine and focusing on it will also help you get out of the gym quickly.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, if others around you are breathing heavily, it is best to keep more than six feet distance from them.Be on additional alert in smaller spaces like locker rooms or fitness studios.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Limit group activities</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of fitness studios, many gyms have restarted their group fitness offerings.While these may be a motivational way to get a workout in, consider the risks before signing up for one.There is evidence that infections spread faster in high-intensiy fitness classes that have more than 20 participants.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if you are planning on joining a group fitness class, ensure that there are a limited number of participants who are properly distanced for the entire workout.Many gyms are also moving their classes online or even outdoors, which is a good alternative to studio based group fitness classes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.Focus on building a routine</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have been unable to visit a gym in months and do not have an adequate home setup to continue the same exercises at the same intensity that they were previously completing in the gym.Because of this, when returning to the gym, it is important to not push yourself too hard or focus on getting back to exactly where you were before the quarantine right from the beginning.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, first focus on reintroducing the gym into your routine.Reacclimate your body with the movements and stressors involved in your gym routine before reattempting your one-repetition maximum or burnout record.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a routine and focusing on it will also help you get out of the gym quickly.Ideally, it is best to minimze the amount of time spent in the gym to reduce exposure risk.Working on a set routine helps with this efficiency.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.Be flexible</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is one thing we have all learned during this year, it is that flexibiltiy is key.Things may change last minute and our plans may no longer be feasible.This applies within the gym as well.You may have planned to exercise with a certain machine or piece of equipment, but it may be occupied or there may be too many people in that section of the gym.Flexibility here is key to helping you still get a meaningful workout when your original plan is no longer possible.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the choice to go back to the gym is highly personal.Medical experts recommend at-home workouts as they are still the safest option, but it is possible to exercise safely at gyms or fitness centers so long as certain precautions are taken, masks are worn, and social distance is maintained.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
