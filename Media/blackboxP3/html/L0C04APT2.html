deserve.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First level the problem with RT-PCR tests is that they are so incredibly inaccurate.If we swab a nasal area for a sample and it finds a single virus which is not an infection the test will multiply the DNA segment or RNA segment millions of times until it gets a positive result.That would seem good but in fact is a serious problem.Disease is dose dependent and RT-PCR fails to react dose dependent.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next problem is that the segment the science team chose for RT-PCR testing may not be unique to COVID-19.We are starting to get real

test kits.You can order rapid HIV tests online from websites.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Rapid tests' are medical diagnostic test devices which can show you whether you are positive or negative for an infection within 20 minutes.Typically you just have to drop a sample (either blood or oral fluid) into the well of a test cassette which looks like this:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, add a given no.of drops of diluent solution into the cassette.The result will appear in the test window within about 20 minutes.Usually the result is shown in terms of red lines.One red line appearing in the test window</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2019-04-20T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Josiah Tay</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Covid 19 test is positive,say a prayer and you have to isolate yourself so that others donâ€™t catch it from you.If you live in a 2 or 3 bedroom apartment with one bath room like we were living one time, it is difficult to do this.Every one at home should wear a mask.Drink plenty of fluids,take Tylenol as needed.Only about one out of 20 gets into trouble and may need to go to the hospital.Chances are that you are going to OK.If you have a bad cough and has even slight difficulty breathing or fast breathing, then you should go to the</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

3 weeks, antibodies by 4 week (3rd gen, lab test), antibody by 42 days by second gen lab test.You can add like 10 days for rapid test.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not all people follow this pattern.Most but not all (97%) are antibody positive by 90 days irrespective of which test is used.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 3% people who seroconvert in 6 months.Usually but not necessarily they have some other health condition.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, windowperiod has two stages</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1- time from exposure to infectious viral load.This is highly variable can be maximum of 6 months.Durin</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-20T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Deigo Salam</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely it is the PCR test.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But please try to understand that PCR is a lengthy procedure.It takes many hours to deliver results.On the other hand rapid tests, as their name suggest, are extremely faster and deliver results within minutes.This becomes very crucial when mass screening has to be done.This saves time and thus many people could be tested in shorter span of time and the suspected individuals could be quarantined at the earliest.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the second part, each and every test kit used for diagnosis is specific to a particular infectious agent.For eg.One cannot use rapid test kit mea</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-20T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Aparna Rakhe</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapid tests are based on antibody detection.The idea behind it is that your body will produce an antibody to try to neutralise the invading virus, and if you test positive for the antibody, the test says you are having the virus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOWEVER, this is important, antibody tests have caveats.</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obvious, just because you test positive, does NOT necessarily mean you are having the virus.The virus could have been gone already but the antibody in your body can still be there, and so the test will say you are positive, but that does not mean you are carrying the virus.This is important because you</li><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-01-13T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Anh Hoang
