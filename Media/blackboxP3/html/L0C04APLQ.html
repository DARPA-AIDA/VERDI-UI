swab test in the Covid-19 test?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very first tests (from China) were very accurate.Somebody, between the White House and the CDC rejected the use of those… nobody knows who decreed that the CDC come up with their own rushed test, but I suspect you can figure out who wanted a 'made in America' test.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDC developed their own.Literally in a matter of days.They were ordered to.And, the dude in the White House went 'live' on January 23, and that was one of his 'bigly' announcements.'And, this days-old test was 'pushed.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That first test developed was a disaster.Once can argue if that was because it was rushed, or 'developed in only days.'but it had way too many false positives, and way too many false negatives.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, it was shipped, and in late January and early February.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the errors were spotted.The CDC began work on a new test.THAT one was pretty accurate.(It is a good thing, because the reliable Chinese test was now nearly impossible to obtain, because every other nation on the planet was demanding it).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whew… But, the CDC Test number 2 (the accurate one) required that the sample be sent to a lab.Test results were slow… Incredibly slow.At first, they had to be sent to the CDCD (!)Then, to either the CDC or a very few additional labs set up as regional stations around the country….but, people did not get results back for 12 days, or 13 days, or 14 days… Ouch.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, there was no chance now of getting those reliable Chinese tests, because more than 180 other nations had flooded China with a backlog, beyond compare.The U.S. was now 'last in line.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, fortunately, private industry did step up.One well-known company (Abbott Labs) developed a rapid test which could show results in less than 15 minutes.Another company (Cepheid), developed one which took about 45 minutes.No sending the stuff out to some lab, and waiting a week or more…</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yippee!But, then, the machines had to be manufactured — in factories, geared up, as fast as they could — while most other nations were receiving and using their own reliable kits.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interim, people were still being tested, and admitted to a hospital, and transferred to an ICU, and in some cases dying — only to have the family finally get the test result… hopefully before final burial.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the newest bungle, from the White House… States needed swabs, in order to conduct the tests.Governors were screaming for swabs.The federal government (the Executive Branch) did then send out swabs, but they were your standard Q-Tips, that you buy in the grocery store.I kid you not.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess what — those do not cut it…</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, some states just said 'go ahead and use them, they must be okay, they came from the federal government, after all!'They are not okay, though.These swabs only allow for a simple swipe around the nostril, near the outer edge.The virus MIGHT be located there, but not very often — it is almost always located deep, deep inside the nostril… One must use a long swab.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some states, had competent health people, and told their Governors that head to obtain long swabs, and instruct testers to do a correct, deep swab.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last weekend, four states reported that their tests were 'inaccurate.'They were using the White House short swabs… right inside the nostril.They and even the press — blamed — 'those new machines!'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a few days to sort out, and Abbott Labs doing some careful education of some Governors — to explain that the issue was not the machines, but the errors were because they were using Q-Tips.The short swabs.The official swabs they had been sent by the federal government.The Donald Trump Q-Tip.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you are tested (which we all should have been, more than a month ago!)— if somebody comes at you with a Q-Tip, go somewhere else.Your test is not going to tell you much of anything… it will yield many false positives, and it will yield many false negatives.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Donald Trump Q-Tip is every bit as effective as chloroquine, in fighting Covid-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Donald Trump Q-Tip is every bit as effective as ramming an ultraviolet lighbulb up your rectum — when it comes to fighting Covid-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, not at all.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not listen to the White House.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do listen to legitimate scientists.</p><p></p><p><p><strong>Content
