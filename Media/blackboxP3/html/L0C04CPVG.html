Public interest must outweigh private gain.The lis between the parties should give way to the larger public good.In view of the above, the kits/test should be sold at a price not beyond Rs.400 per kit/test inclusive of GST,' the Delhi High Court ordered.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Delhi High Court order, both parties have agreed to sell antibody test kits in India at the court-mandated price of Rs 400 per kit, inclusive of GST.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to both parties, Delhi High Court decided that 2.24 lakh tests shall be delivered to ICMR, the moment it land in India.The balance amount of Rs.8.25 crore has to be first paid to importer Matrix Labs within 24 hours of petitioner receiving monies from ICMR, before they are adjusted for any purpose.The court also ordered remaining 26,000 kits from the Tamil Nadu government's order to be provided directly to the stated the moment they reach India.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'So, from the other 5 lakh kits/tests, 50,000 shall be excluded for the State of Tamil Nadu and the remaining 450,000 would be available to the respondent to be disposed-off in terms of the above, directly to any Government or governmental agency or any private entity which has received due approval to carry out such tests,' the court ordered.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALSO READ:Coronavirus India Highlights: Total cases inch closer to 27,000; casualties due to COVID-19 at 826</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-27T19:00:00<br></p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CPVO.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04C5JV.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CPVQ.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/gif/L0C04C5JR.gif' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C5JW.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C5K3.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C5JU.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C5JJ.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-04-27</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-30</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04CPVG</p></body></html>
