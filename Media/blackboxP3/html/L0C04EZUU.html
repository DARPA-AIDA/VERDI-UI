Arrest?</h1><p>Ukraine — Poroshenko Facing House Arrest?</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criminal case was opened at the request of lawyer Andrei Portnov.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case is related to appointments to certain offices.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poroshenko court was postponed to July 1st, due to the death of his father.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is a big day for former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.The Ukrainian Prosecutor General will expect Poroshenko in his office under suspicion of committing a crime under Article 109, 'actions aimed at overthrowing the constitutional order.'Such a charge carries five to ten years in prison.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petro Poroshenko (born 26 September 1965) is a Ukrainian businessman and politician who served as the fifth President of Ukraine from 2014 to 2019.</figcaption><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C0495Y0.jpg' style='max-width:

influence on the holding of a competition to select candidates for the appointment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, the criminal case was opened in 2019, when Iryna Venediktova was head of the State Bureau of Investigations (SBI) Only now, when she became the Prosecutor General, she got her chance in the case of the seizure of power.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the previous suspicion of abuse of authority, when appointing Serhii Semochko as head of the Foreign Intelligence Service, this is progress.At least because Article 109 does not provide for such soft measures of restraint as house arrest or bail.Just an arrest.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Poroshenko should give explanations about his actions with the importation of a collection of paintings by Russian artists into the country.According to the name of the painting by Ilya Glazunov, which turned out to be purchased by Petro Poroshenko from himself through an offshore firm, among 43 other paintings by Benois, Aivazovsky, Korovin and other artists.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, the ex-President was lured to an interrogation in the case of the 'Russian beauty' painting.Poroshenko then behaved with courage and dignity.he jumped up and very quickly ran out the back door.Then, he gathered a support group from representatives of his political faction, European Solidarity,and broke into the office of the Prosecutor General.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provoked a scandal, which demanded that the Prosecutor General personally handed the 'pidozra' not sent 'obscure people.'It was nice to watch the sweating ex-commander-in-chief, who yelled in a glamorous black mask with hand embroidery.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iryna Venediktova is a Ukrainian politician, lawyer, Doctor of Law, Professor.On 17 March 2020, Venediktova was appointed as the Prosecutor General.She became the first female prosecutor in the history of Ukraine to chair the Prosecutor General’s Office.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, on July 1, the Pechersk court in Kyiv should continue to consider the case on the election of a preventive measure against Poroshenko.The first attempt was not very successful because the commander-in-chief gathered about five or six thousand 'gunpowder' from all over the country, brought them to the building of the Pechersk court, and put on a bright show.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poroshenko used his father’s death to get out of the court proceedings.The hearing was then postponed until July 1.This is a very correct decision, by the way, since the 'gunpowder' fighters from the Democratic Axe were already ready to break into the courthouse and snatch their leader (the first letter like 'El') from the 'clutches of Putin’s justice.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, with the first case, everything is more or less clear-an exit to conditional freedom under a personal obligation, then with the second it is not so simple.If the suspect does not appear for questioning, specially trained employees of the office of the Prosecutor General will lie in wait for Petro Oleksiyovych with his witnesses in their places of residence.They can, for example, intercept the ex-commander-in-chief on the way to the Verkhovna Rada or come to his home.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The office of the Prosecutor General demands to choose a measure of restraint.For such a heavy article as the seizure of power, this is only an arrest.However, there is a loophole.Ukrainian courts use the so-called 'European practice'in their proceedings.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we are a humane state, and in Europe there are precedents when suspects in such crimes were released under house arrest.Overall, the future of the former Candy King Poroshenko is not very good at this time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
