for confrontation with China</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my belief that China already started the confrontation.Or did he just not listen to the meeting in Alaska, or he didn't understand?But, so far he has not laid down the Rubicon, so he can keep backing up and changing it as his mentor Obama did.Grow a backbone,</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are one of the three major powers in our world</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Quit acting like a small child cowing before everybody, and giving the bullies whatever they want.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

waters, with their floating islands.They're planning to take over Taiwan faster than the ten years our Government has predicted.If this administration doesn't make it clear to China that this isn't going to go down, then it won't be long before the US will fall.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-11T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
