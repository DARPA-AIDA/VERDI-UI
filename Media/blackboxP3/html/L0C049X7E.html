hour</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WRONG ILLEGAL ALIENS.They are not MIGRANTS and are coming here to take American jobs not fleeing any type of aggression.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

this is that the stuff is coming out of the pockets of hard working Americans rather than Biden's pocket.Perhaps he should pitch in some of his 10% from his pay to play and influence peddling schemes conducted with his brother and son, Hunter.This illegal immigration needs to end - NOW.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

Americans will pay the interest on.Lisa Murkowski, Mitch McConnel, the Big Guy, and other communists will NOT feel bad.You can bet everything you got on it because its already done.Without a shot being fired.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Amarcis Young</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rep Scalise is part of the RINO leadership that blames Biden for the border crisis, but will go along with amnesty for illegals later!They didn't go along with President Trump when he tried to close the border and end illegal immigration.It's why we need an America First Congress!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Dempanic is over, we will still have 20-30 million illegals dragging our country down!Amnesty rewards illegals with legal status, Democrats with new voters, and donors with cheap labor.But it punishes US citizens with declining wages and living standards!It does nothing about cheap labor, drugs, crime, and gangs.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>FamousJamous</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every member of Congress that has been in office for the past 40 years is to blame for the almost 40 million illegals already in the USA and they never intended to deport them since they always underfunded both ICF and the BP.ICE only has about 5,000 employees when we actually need 50,000 ICD staff to clean out this country.Elected officials were just waiting for the number of illegals to get so large so that they could just throw up their hands and all say lets grant them amnesty.The majority of illegals coming in now already have relatives living in this country illegally and they will help all fill out the forms for food stamps, section 8 housing, Medicaid, etc.even though millions of Americans could use those benefits but there is not enough money to dole out so illegals get everything first and more if they just drop an anchor baby as our government will never deport them.Seems to me that if there is only one American child in a family and the rest are illegally here, the entire family should be sent back to their native country as that American child is the responsibility of it's parents and not the US government nor it's citizens.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

shameless 'empty suit' placeholder Joe disgracing the Oval Office sold his soul to devil and is selling America to the highest bidders, where ChiComs evidently have priority place.President Trump was (and is) so right dubbing that evidently corrupted 'Quid pro Quo Biden' more precise in 2020 as Beijing Biden.And even that warning didn't make GOP 'leadership' worried about potential prospects of losing all political powers in Washington DC with stolen elections' outcomes in 2020 as the result of stabbing President Trump in the back.Now GOP 'leadership' is maneuvering and crying foul, never admitting own failures to protect Elections' integrity, which would've lead to President Trump's re-election for the second term.Disgusting.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

US.'Well, given taht Gallup is Liberal outlet and calls illegal aliens as 'immigrants', even that organization urges Americans about impending disaster.So, in addition to over estimated 30 Millions of illegal aliens roaming across our homeland and residing in over 350 so called 'sanctuary cities', Millions more are poised to illegally cross our Sovereign Borders at rate of at least 100 persons per hour?Isn't it an INVASION on foreigners' part and surrender of our Sovereignty by current U.S. Government, which arrogantly breaks the Oath to serve We the People?</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
