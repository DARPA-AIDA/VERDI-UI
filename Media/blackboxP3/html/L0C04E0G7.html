empathy.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are more similar than we are different.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our black and brown brothers and sisters can not win on their own.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t get the picture out of my mind…our President holding the Bible in front of a church for a photo op during this time of chaos.He didn’t pray.He didn’t provide any words of wisdom.He didn’t urge unity, hope, forgiveness, or justice.He didn’t comfort.He didn’t educate.He simply stood there…then brought up more white people for the photo op.To make matters worse—he escalated the tensions.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More people are being hurt.Officers are being shot in the streets.It’s all just so wrong.Who are the geniuses who even crafted all of this?They could have at least tried to make the escapade believable.True Christianity evolves out of empathy.This man has none.If he did, he wouldn’t have sent police on horseback through a peaceful protest knocking people over and firing tear-gas and rubber bullets.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are more similar than we are different.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think this man has ever been in the home of a poor person, or even a middle class person?Do you think he has ever felt their pain?Do you think he has ever felt your pain?I have a lot of black friends, brown friends and everything in between.During the 30 plus years of my career, I have worked at a crisis center for youth, at Big Brothers Big Sisters in two different cities, and at a homeless shelter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the privilege of working with people of color, both as colleagues, supervisors, board members and clients.I have family of color.I have been in some of the poorest homes in some of the roughest neighborhoods…and have met some of the best human beings—of all races.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority were facing obstacles the average person would not understand, much less know how to navigate.Yet the majority of them were incredible human beings.They were real.They had pain, sorrow, regret, and challenges, the likes most of us would never know.But they developed empathy.They developed empathy through their pain.They were strong enough to overcome their struggles and to become really good human beings despite the deck being stacked against them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They showed me more kindness than I have received in the rest of the world.They taught me lessons I would have otherwise never known.In short, they made me a better person.I was welcomed more in the projects than I was at socialite fundraisers.Empathy.Pain.Struggles.That is what makes people real.It doesn’t matter the color of our skin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are more similar than we are different.All of our hearts are red.As a white person, I will never truly know how it is to be black or brown.But how do we, as white people bridge this gap?We need to open ourselves to new experiences.We need to get out of our comfort zones and interact with people that look different than we do.We need to listen and to develop understanding and empathy.We need to allow for love.And when we see something we don’t like nor agree with, we need to forgive.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need not to allow racist remarks in our presence.We need to speak out when we see injustices.We need to get involved on a local level.We need to develop relationships.We need to let true Christianity in our hearts.That is the only way to make things better.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing in front of a church holding a Bible is not the answer.Anybody can do that.It doesn’t mean anything.Nothing.We can’t listen to certain politicians.They do not care.In fact, divisiveness may actually serve their purposes.We have to take care of one another.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all connected on a spiritual level.So when we are kind, empathetic and act in love, not only do we help the other person, we help ourselves and our family.Our black and brown brothers and sisters can not win on their own.And the 'win' is simply being treated equally and with humanity.It’s really not a big ask.And it is way past time to make this happen.But it takes everybody.We need to do better.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space

countries not allowing salon to reopen even after 2 months of lock down.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salon industry won’t be same as before.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could’ve never imagined anything happening that would bring about the shift that the beauty industry has experienced.Most economic downturns that have occurred in the United States have resulted in more revenue for hair care professionals.Even if our local or regional areas were destroyed, we could go and work somewhere else.The COVID-19 coronavirus has taught us differently and our ways of operations are forever changed.We are now stronger in many areas of our careers and personal lives.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salon experience poses a risk to salon owners, staff, and clients.Best practices are essential to lower the risk.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us have elevated our standards in our operations with safer practices and more structured systems.Before COVID, lackluster performance and poor business practices were the norm.Stacking appointments to achieve a certain work volume contributed to a compromise in sanitation and professionalism.Clients would be subjected to spending unnecessary hours in the shop for styles that could have taken far less time with proper time management.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salon experience will never be as it once was.A new norm should be expected.I believe it is time for an industry-standard reset.Our industry has been lacking in solidarity and professionalism in some areas for quite some time.This Covid-19 experience has created a need to maximize professionalism and write some new policies, procedures, and guidelines for our salons.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to Covid-19, there is equal risk for the stylists and the clients.With personal protection equipment (face masks, gloves, hair straightening Ironing and cream) use for chemical treatment like Hair Smoothening and Rebonding added sanitation practices and fewer guests allowed in the salon at the same time, we will need to do our best to still make salon experiences provide the pampering feel we did before Covid-19, while remaining profitable.All salon visits should be considered a luxury.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salon experience poses a risk to salon owners, staff, and clients.Best practices are essential to lower the risk.PPE is an absolute necessity to be worn by you and your client.Stay well-stock with PPE.Because of additional costs, there will need to be price adjustments.They are necessary because the cost of doing business has gone up.Mask gloves, thermometers, paperwork, the time it will cost your receptionist a cost.These are all the new costs.To cover costs, we might see a price hike in the services offered</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety precautions you should take:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the goal is to have an all-inclusive list of what you should do, common sense will be the rule.Some of these suggestions may uncomfortable, but they are critical.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determine if your client has been exposed.Ask if they have been around people with the virus, or if they are caring for people who are sick.Determine if they wear masks or other PPE when in groups.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social distancing must be practiced.Do not overcrowd the salon.Chairs should be distanced and allow only one client per stylist in the salon.Don’t have customers sitting and waiting.This will require a schedule that you maintain.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must require constant and consistent disinfection.The stations must be sanitized before and after every client, this includes disinfecting the chair, irons, combs, station tops.</li></p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Require prepayment through one of the many services- Paytm, Phone-Pay etc.Stop taking cash.Cash is filthy and has a high potential for contamination.</li></p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing clear and concrete communication with customers will help to inform them of all updates and changes taking place within the business.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing clear and concrete communication with customers will help to inform them of all updates and changes taking place within the business.This includes changes in salon rules and regulations, pre-screenings, etc.Failure to communicate ALL necessary details that impact the client and staff experience can cause problems that could result in lawsuits and a poor business reputation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanitation</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having clear sanitation policies for both staff and clients is critically important.Failure to implement these mandates could result in the exchange of germs, harmful bacteria and disease.This would also place the business at a higher risk of being a health hazard.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule Adjustments</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will Enforce new scheduling to comply with the current public health crisis mandate allows for proper social distancing.Adding policies state consequences for tardiness from both staff and clients will help to keep a steady and controlled flow of operations.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food and Beverage</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts to maintain a clean and sterile work environment cannot be effective when food and beverages are allowed in the business.There should be a clause in the updated policies that prohibits food or drinks in the salon or shop.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Distancing</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every client should be made aware of what social distancing looks like in your business.Government standards suggest 6 feet of spacing between clients.Businesses should also rearrange their space to create an environment in which clients can feel safe and secure in their distance.This should be included in policies and procedures for reporting.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch-less Payments</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clients mustn’t feel like they are compromising their health just to make a payment.There are plenty of options.It is best if you have as many of these options as possible.Businesses of every size from new startups to public companies use some type of software to accept payments and manage their businesses online.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s normal … next?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As salons emerge from Recovery and transition into the Thrive phase, trust, coupled with the five qualities of resilient leadership, serves as a strong foundation on which resilient leaders can build the business models to address the new opportunities that will emerge.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we receive notifications on our mobile devices, indicating that a software update is required to allow our phones to work more effectively, we generally respond in agreement.Upon completion of the software update, our devices aesthetics looks the same.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the applications on our devices appear with varying icons.It may take a moment for us to adjust to the new undertakings of the device.But we adjust with time.Let’s all embrace the new software updates in our operations as the globe will make the necessary shifts.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incumbent on us in the salon industry to collaboratively create and develop new anchored approaches toward distal outcomes.Let’s refrain from being deficit-based and more asset-based.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
