tens to hundreds of thousands of votes in each state until the early morning following the election.Nineteen attorneys general (Department of Justice) and 106 members of the Texas Congress supported the lawsuit filed with the Supreme Court to annul the election result.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the court rejected this lawsuit Friday, based on the fact that the legal position of the state of Texas does not allow it to file a lawsuit, which came in the form of a decision issued by the court to reject the request of this US state.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court’s decision stated: 'Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court’s rejection of this request adds a new failure for Trump, who had previously suggested that the results of last November’s elections would be settled in the Supreme Court.Earlier this week, the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit challenging Democratic candidate Biden’s victory in Pennsylvania, a rejection stated in a one-sentence ruling.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald Trump repeated his assertion on more than one occasion, that 'illegal votes' had cost him a second term.Since the election, Trump and his supporters have filed a number of lawsuits challenging with hundreds of affidavits from witnesses and experts in the 2020 presidential election results, but none of them have succeeded to date.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Gwin, a Biden spokesman, said: ‘Biden’s clear and commanding victory will be ratified by the Electoral College on Monday, and he will be sworn in on January 20.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton said: 'I will continue to tirelessly defend the integrity and security of our elections and hold accountable those who shirk established election law for their own convenience.'</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. is an American

with just over 10,700 votes – and he initially declared Joe Biden the victory in this state in the 2020 election.On November 4, the Trump campaign team filed a lawsuit to halt the counting process in the state because his observers were removed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge rejected the case, saying there was insufficient evidence to prove that election monitoring and supervision procedures were not followed.He filed a lawsuit on Nov.9 seeking to block certification of the results in Wayne County, using other complaints from election observers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevada</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A court case was filed on the 5th of this month claiming that there are 'lax procedures in verifying the authenticity of ballot papers sent by mail and that there are more than 3000 examples of persons not entitled to vote who sent ballot papers' by mail.President Trump’s legal team compiled a list of people who allegedly moved out of the state but took part in the ballot.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ongoing Challenges</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President’s attorney, Giuliani said the president and his team believe, 'above and beyond President Trump and Joe Biden, these facts need to be heard.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans are loosing confidence in the election process.The post-election survey, taken November 9-15 among 2,752 respondents, showed that Democrats and Republicans remain sharply divided regarding the efficiency and accuracy of the democratic process this election cycle.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow us</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
