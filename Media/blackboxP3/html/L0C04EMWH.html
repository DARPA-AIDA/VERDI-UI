as the winner of the presidential election but nonetheless insisted that such a decision would be a 'mistake.'</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his 25 minute back-and-forth with the media, Trump didn’t concede his loss and insisted his legal arguments would go ahead.</figcaption><p><img src='../jpg/L0C0495XU.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On vacating the White House, the President said: 'Certainly I will.But you know that' Trump said Thursday 'a lot of things' would happen between now and then.Trump as has been his norm lately once again alleged massive fraud in the elections and even went ahead to compare the situation to the elections thieving norm in third world countries.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President however didn’t offer any proof in regard to the alleged electoral malpractices.It was the first time that President Trump was taking questions from journalists since Election Day.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump spoke during a speech at the White House after holding a Thanksgiving video conference with members of the United States military service.The President however once again refused to admit that he was defeated in the November 3rd US Presidential Election.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It’s going to be a very hard thing to concede because we know there was massive fraud,' said the President.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump equally didn’t commit himself on whether or not he would attend an inauguration ceremony for Joe Biden.The inauguration ceremony is scheduled for January 20th next year.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has been adamant in his previous comments stating that the election was rigged and that there was massive fraud and that people are going to be shocked when they find out.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Campaigns in Georgia.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump also used the opportunity to announce that he will travel to Georgia next week to hold a rally in support of the two Republican Senate candidates, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who are in tough competition in a runoff with their Democratic opponents, scheduled for January 5th.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding his future plans, Trump declined to reveal on whether he would possibly seek the US presidency in 2024 as it is already being speculated from some quarters.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transition to Biden</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President reiterated theories about voting machines changing votes for him to Biden, complained the election was ‘rigged’ and alleged Biden only got his record 80 million votes through ‘massive fraud.’</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump’s kind of first softening of stance came on Monday when he gave orders to the General Administration Service (GSA) to provide Biden’s transition team with everything they need (from federal funds to intelligence reports) to start the power transfer process.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike most countries in the world, Americans do not elect the president and vice president by direct vote, but instead, give that responsibility to the Electoral College, made up of 538 voters representing all states.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 8th is 'SafeHarbor' the date by which states must certify results and assign electors.If an election is in dispute, state legislatures may assign electors.Electors meet in their states to cast votes for the President and Vice President on December 14th.The new Congress is sworn in on January 3rd and the 117th session starts.Then on Jan 6th the Electoral votes are counted in the House Chamber by members of the House and Senate.If neither candidate has 270 electoral college votes, the election is in dispute.In a disputed election, the House will appoint the President with each state getting one vote.The Senate will choose the Vice President.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biden garnered 306 voters compared to 232 obtained by Trump according the press on election day.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow
