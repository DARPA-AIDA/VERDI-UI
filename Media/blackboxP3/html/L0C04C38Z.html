'Both these enigmatic diseases make sense however under a Panspermia in-fall model and the evidence consistent with such a model is critically reviewed.'Apparently.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There does appear to have been a meteorite strike in China on Oct.13 of last year, and hey, there was a major pandemic that started shortly thereafter, so … maybe?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theory holds that most of the infections around the world, particularly in the major hotspots (Wuhan, aboard the Diamond Princess, among others) were caused not by human-to-human transmission but by contact with miniscule fragments of the original meteor as they swirled around the troposphere.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunspots are also involved somehow?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the study says, 'This leads to the alternate hypothesis that COVID-19 arrived via a meteorite, a presumed relatively fragile and loose carbonaceous meteorite, that struck North East China on October 11, 2019.'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-09-09T03:21:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Jordan Fenster</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C39U.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C392.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C391.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C39T.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C39M.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C39S.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C39K.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C39R.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C39L.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C39Q.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C39O.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C39N.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04C39P.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2020-09-09</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-13</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04C38Z</p></body></html>
