Coronavirus Vaccine Acquisition Mechanism).The international initiative aims to ensure fair access to the COVID-19 vaccine in all countries and regions around the world.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald John Trump is the 45th and current president of the United States, and the Republican Party nominee for the 2020 presidential

United States cannot accept the restrictions of the COVAX multinational project, under the influence of the 'corrupt WHO and China.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project is jointly led by the International Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Alliance for Epidemiological Prevention Innovation (CEPI), and WHO.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White House spokesman Judd Deere said:</p><p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Under President Trump’s leadership, vaccine and therapeutic research, development, and trials have advanced at unprecedented speed to deliver groundbreaking, effective medicines driven by data and safety and not held back by government red tape.'</blockquote></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added, 'the United States will continue to engage our international partners to ensure we defeat this virus, but we will not be constrained by multilateral organizations influenced by the corrupt World Health Organization and China.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June of this year, the United States withdrew from the WHO.President Trump accused the organization of reporting the dangers of the new coronavirus and being under the control of the Beijing government, while the number of funds provided by China to the organization was much lower than that of the United States.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump accused the World Health Organization of being responsible for the global formation of the new coronavirus pandemic and its high death toll.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deere said in a statement that President Trump will invest huge sums of money to thoroughly test the vaccine to ensure that every new coronavirus vaccine must comply with the FDA regulations and standards to save lives.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coronavirus Vaccine Hunt</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'From a global health perspective it’s a very unwise decision,' said Andrea Feigl-Ding, founder and CEO of the Health Finance Institute.'It’s symptomatic of a death culture.That’s a strong word, but us versus them helps no one.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, dozens of countries have expressed interest in participating in COVAX cooperation.The plan involves multiple vaccines.Once a candidate vaccine is confirmed as safe and effective, it will be put into mass production immediately, and 2 billion vaccines will be produced by the end of 2021.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amount of vaccine will guarantee the supply of medical staff in countries around the world, and people who are particularly threatened because of their age or previous medical history.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I think we need to keep in mind that we’re only safe if everybody is safe,' Seth Berkley, who heads GAVI, the vaccine alliance, told The Hill in an interview in July.'If the pandemic is raging out of control in other countries, you still won’t go back to normal travel, tourism, commerce.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, the WHO warned that in the war epidemic, countries should not act alone and all countries should fund the COVAX International Initiative.WHO Director-General Tan Desai last week called for avoiding 'vaccine nationalism,' saying that 'the limited (vaccine) supply is shared strategically and globally, which is in fact in the interest of every country.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EU announced last week that it would donate €400 million in funding for the initiative.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space
