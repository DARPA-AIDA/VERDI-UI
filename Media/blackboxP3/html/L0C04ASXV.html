Crazy Or Kill Me Yet</h1><p>My Mother Is Gonna Drive Me Crazy Or Kill Me Yet</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ohhhh, I am sooo ticked off at her right now.Finally talked her into staying home like we have all been told to do.I thought she finally understood, no going on cruises, no going to town every day, no going anywhere, just stay at home.Thought she finally had that understood.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a wild guess what she's done now?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last time I happened to look outside yesterday about noon her car was still in her driveway, Didn't look out today but she called me about an hour ago and i'm still fuming.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went to Texas to visit my brother, his girlfriend and her 3 youngun's.She left out yesterday about 1pm.Got there about 6pm.She's staying until Tuesday or Wednesday before coming back home and while there she's planning on going around and visiting old friends and her 2 granddaughters and 1 great granddaughter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will not be allowed to visit over here for another 2 weeks once she gets home and now I may make that a month.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

of.My brother and his girlfriend don't believe this stuff is all that serious so others around there may not think so either.We'll see.</blockquote></p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

Sockpuppet</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to my mother a few days ago, and we agreed that the annual Easter weekend visit would not be a good idea.She's 79 now and doesn't need to be exposed to anything.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been worried because my brother, who looks after her, works in the local public library and there's no telling what he's exposed to in that setting.However, Mom told me that the library closed to the public a couple of weeks ago.You can still check out books online, and they will arrange for no-contact delivery.But they don't even want the books back until all this is over.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, that makes me feel better that he's not exposing her to anything he would have otherwise picked up.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted

COPD, diabetes and heart problems.At first she just went about like normal, which means shopping daily for entertainment, going to a mega church, eating out almost daily, etc.'No one's going to tell me what to do.'Couldn't talk her into stocking up, sanitizing, social distancing, nothing.When the virus started hitting her area it seems to have scared her a bit and she did do a bit of stocking up, talked about staying home, quit going to church for now.BUT, I just found out she is still shopping frequently (HAD to have chocolate Easter eggs, you know), still eating out frequently and has half a dozen friends over daily.One friend goes visiting at just about every house on the street each day, then finishes up at my mom's.She doesn't stay 6 ft away from anyone.Mom says she can't tell her stay away because she doesn't want to lose a friend and besides she enjoys the visits from everyone.I've given up trying to talk to her, whatever happens, happens, I guess.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

won't travel any other route) and would have to stop at least twice, maybe more, for gas, food, bathroom breaks.That route is extremely heavily traveled, being the main route from the Houston area to the DFW area.To me, the risk of being exposed to the virus would be too great just based on the sheer numbers of people who travel that route.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

stuck at the house more than 2 days she get's nervous and jittery.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back 8 years ago she had to have a pacemaker put in and the dr told her no driving for a week.The next day I had to take her keys away from her because she wanted to go to town because she was bored.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if she can't or dosen't realize how bad this could be to her or others.I've explained this to her dozens of times and she'll act like she's never heard me tell her about this stuff.She dosen't watch the news but when she does it's like she dosen't comprehend what she's heard.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is seriously starting to worry me because we have been having this same discussion going on a good 2 months now.I finally thought I had this through her head.She has not been able to stay at home more than 3 days straight.She keeps going to the store to get her a drink, she dosen't like canned drinks, she dosen't like tea made at home, she has to get her a styrofoam cup of ice with a pop of some kind.She has to get fresh food from the store, she's got plenty of other stuff like canned food, frozen meats she can thaw, etc.But no she's gotta be going someplace.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reminds me of my late husband.He couldn't sit still when he was home off the truck.He had to be going somewhere doing something.I always said that if and when he came off the truck for good he wouldn't last a year and I was right about that.He lasted 11 months.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will be the same way.I figure if she has to go in a nursing home 1 of these days I doubt she'll last 6 months.When i've threatened to take her keys away from her now she tells me she'll start getting a cab or 1 of our senior citizens buses to take her places.That woman is bound and determined she is not gonna stay home for anything.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me, I haven't been away from this house in 2 months except once and that was to go to the dr to get blood work so I could get refills on my prescriptions.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-04-05T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:
