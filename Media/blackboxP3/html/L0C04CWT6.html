world going head over heels on experimental scientific evidence and not trusting basic clinical judgement and prudence, I would say there is no evidence about use of prednisone or methylprednisolone in COVID-19 and so you must stand in the queue for dexamethasone only.Allow me to mention here that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) long ago has provided advisory for using methylprednisolone in moderate and severe COVID-19 disease, and it is not only clinically sensible, it is working.ICMR has also advised HCQ use in mild and moderate COVID-19 disease, and THAT is working, too, but that is a sad and tainted issue for reasons none of which are scientific.We are justified in being skeptical about press releases regarding results not backed by release of data.Thanks.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-23T03:32:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Prof U.K. Bhadra</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Paul — Most of the

used.The life saving effect of these corticosteroids are not specific for COVID-19.Hans Selye described 70 years ago in his book 'Stress' (Acta Inc.,.Med..Publ.Montreal, 1950) that any stressful condition can elicit a chain of events he called the general adaptation syndrome which has 3 phases:1) the alarm reaction, 2)the stage of resistance and 3) the stage of exhaustion.Stress stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete excessive amounts of corticosteroids.If the condition reaches the 3rd stage, the adrenal cortex fails and as a result, causes adrenocortical insufficiency and, ultimately, death.The administraion of glucocorticosteroids can save the patient’s life via a non-specific mechanism, irrespective of the underlying disease.I was Selye’s postgraduate student 60 years ago, hence you get it from the horse’s mouth.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-22T17:42:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Miklos Nadasdi

wonder drug that will work wonders.It is NOT an antiviral.It is a steroid that has immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activity.What does inflammation have to do with COVID-19 infection.Most COVID-19 infections are mild or asymptomatic in adults below 55.But in infections with all blown symptoms associated with COVID-19, mostly in patients above 55 or those with genetic or acquired immunodeficiencies there is a progression to the next stage of uncontrolled inflammation accompanied by multiple organ inflammatory damage.That is when Dexamethasone could be a life saver.From what we know now that we did not know 4 months ago when COVID-19 was spreading like wild fire is those who were dying were dying not as much from the lung damage due to uncontrolled COVID-19 multiplication and proliferation as much as the inflammation due to proinflammatory cytokines and chemotactic complement components.Any one advocating prescribing Dexamethasone during the early days of COVID-19 infection is making a big blunder.During the early days the immune system needs all the support it can get with antivirals and not be suppressed by something like Dexamethasone which should be more an end stage treatment when oxygen level as seen in an oxymeter fall below 95%.Please my friends be very careful to ensure that the timing and the case justifies administering Dexamethasone.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-27T11:12:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Girish J Kotwal</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I absolutely agree with Dr. Kotwal.I’m no tan expert in infectious/Inflammatory diseases, but for what we have seen in our critically ill pacients, the ones who benefit from corticoesteroids are the ones in late stages of the disease or in the contrary, the ones who have a disproporcionate inflammatory response during the first week of illness; all of them connected to VMI, critically ill, where the lungs showed a characteristic low compliance and you could suspect that an inflammatory response is the most probably cause for this pattern.We also have seen that pacients in these late phases of COVID-19 tend to have bacterial co-infections, so maybe it would be safe to check that possibily before giving corticoesteroids in high doses.The last thing I would like to say is actually a personal question.Why did they choose Dexamethasone and not another corticoesteroid?One would assume that all of them should have the same effect (If used in equipotencial doses) in diminishing the inflammatory response.I apologyze if I my writing has orthographic mistakes (it’s been a while since the last time I wrote in english).Good luck to you all.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

Solumedrol, an I.V. steroid in the late 1980s and 1990s for almost all patients with PCP before Septra was to take affect .We called it'pharmacological last rites', but then realized that it allowed for respiratory rescue before intubation.This was at the Univ.of Maryland Medical System.Up to 10% of our in patient population had AIDS.PCP was the devastating infection that patients came in with, not even knowing they had AIDS.The lungs were so overwhelmed with PCP, that respiratory failure was sometimes hours away, and intubation and mechanical ventilation did next to nothing except causing barotrauma.It was treating the doctor more than treating the patient.But we found that steroids treated the so called 'cytokine storm', although we didn’t call it that then, just ARDS.As a retired physician sailing my boat around the world, I assumed that steroids would be in the armamentarium for any respiratory failure if a patient is close to 'circling the drain'.I hope it didn’t take 4 months to figure that one out.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-27T11:20:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Carolyn J. Harrington</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You bring back memories.We approached the PCP crisis patients the same way in Houston, and saw some pulled back from the brink… yes, on the order of 10%.What we knew when we started the protocol was we were seeing low impedance overwhelming and atypical pneumonia with a massive 'sepsis' response (cytokine storm).Early in the AIDS outbreak, we didn’t know what we were dealing with and rarely isolated pneumocystis.We treated empirically.High dose steroids, after failure of a serious course of IV antibiotics allowed us to save enough patients to more carefully consider what a treatment course might look like if we could codify it into protocols, which helped.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

severely ill patients with COVID have.And it is almost never a good idea to stop a study early unless clear negative results are evident.The studies are powered to reach end points and stopping early negates this goal.So I believe with limited options, Dex is a good choice for the most severely ill patients with COVID infections.Just don’t be surprised if these results don’t hold up in subsequent

unqualified approval for a treatment, even if it does take until 2024 and tens of thousands will die in the meantime.For now, and in my opinion, what we should be using in a hospital setting is Remdesivir, but the FDA’s EUA specifies only for 'severe' cases.Anyone who knows anything about viruses knows that the best time to attack a virus is in the early stages but the FDA has its own (bureaucratic) reasons for waiting, I guess.Doctors with actual patients tend to be more willing to help cure the patients, but they are stymied by officialdom, who tell them to WAIT.In our state we have yet to receive Remdesivir but I understand there may be some use of dexamethasone since it’s so ubiquitous.I understand too there are antiviral sprays for early use being developed by the good scientists at our drug companies, but Heaven forbid we should try these on patients before the official FDA approval years from now.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

corticosteroids for COVID-19, so I’m so happy we may actually, although way later than should have happened, begin to see that treatment being used.Thank you for your sensible and very useful presentation.But, the corticosteroid Rx should not wait for desperation cases on ventilators.It should be prescribed for any COVID-19 patient with persisting shortness of breath, even if not hospitalized, or if hospitalized but not yet in ICU.I’ve been an MD for 59 years, so I know a thing or two since I’ve seen a thing or two.Patient health results ranks first.Nothing else has any ranking.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-28T16:43:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Edward Marshall MD</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a known physiological fact that Adrenal Cortex goes into overdrive in Acute Stress.If a person comes to know he has COVID infection, he or she is already in acute stress not knowing what the outcome may be.And when dyspnoea sets in the stress levels increase more.Adrenals will go into further overdrive leading to Adrenal fatigue.Our own bodies stress hormones will start to fall leading to more inflammation of endothelium of blood Vessels and alveoli.This will lead to exudate in alveoli and thrombus formation in blood vessels – vasculitis and alveolitis, which had already been initiated by the infection.So giving external steroids will help the adrenals to recover from fatigue and the steroids in its part help reduce inflammation.Acute dosage for short term usage of steroids will not cause immunosuppressive effect.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-29T04:53:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Dr Subhashchandra Shah</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media and most medical journals are ignoring the work of a group of US clinicians who have been successfully using Methylprednisolone to save the lives of Covid-19 patients.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This distinguished group of clinicians have come together to form the Frontline Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance.They are using the MATH+ protocol whose core elements are Methylprednisolone, high dose IVC, thiamine and heparin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr.Joseph Varon, is Chief of Clinical Care at the United Memorial Medical Center in Houston, TX.Dr. Varon has been using the MATH+ treatment solution from the Covid Unit of one of America’s latest Corona Virus epicenters.In an interview with the Journal of Modern Healing Dr. Varon has commented:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The virus is very unique and what we’re seeing now, the severity of illness for us is increasing from all these mass gatherings… but also the people‐‐ they don’t give too much attention to the virus.By the time they come to us, it’s often too late.MATH+ works beautifully when you start early.So the sooner I can start you off, the better off you are!'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-29T08:16:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>dylan murphy</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Sax, I worry that we do not have information (at least not yet available) of the impact of immune plasma on the outcome of this patients.If there is benefit as others have reported, are the benefits of dexamethasone still evident?Is dexamethasone better than plasma plus no other treatment (or any of the other treatments shown to be non-effective)?Is dexamethasone plus immune plasma better than immune plasma alone?Is 28 days enough to evaluate for secondary infections (bacterial, fungal, VAP/CLABSI/UTI)?If immune plasma (or remdesevir) offer similar benefit, is dexamethasone still indicated?Should it replace these other treatment modalities or used only when these are not available or added to these?I think many questions remain to better understand the role and potential risks of this treatment modality.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-06-29T13:15:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>antonio arrieta</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tue.But other things matter including the intensity of standard of care and appropriate dose.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also mechanical ventilation is an endpoint with truly compound heterogeneous pathways.We are awaiting data by presence and severity of ARDS.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to cytokine storm (or tornado), it may induce emotional reactions when sometimes the best thing is to pause and assess the pathological mechanisms of clinical deterioration.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-04T11:11:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Nadim Salomon</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHY DEXAMETHASONE and not i-v methylprednisolone ?Since CoV attacks not only the epithelial cells (resp tract, kidney, gastro-intestinal tract) but also the ENDOTHELIAL cells, which is responsible for the diffuse microangeiitis with endothelial dysfunction, DIC, micro- macrothrombosis and cause ischemic lesions in the heart and brain methylprednisone which does NOT readily cross de Blood Brain Barrier whould have NO protective effetc on the cerebral lesions of COVID.Dexamethasone DOES readily cross the BBB, attenuate the endothelial inflammation, diminish cerebral edema and intracranial pressure, only DEXAMETHASONE should be applied.In patient with less drammatic clinical presentation.corticosteroids coul facilitate viral replication and attenuate a functioning immunologic response.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2020-07-16T21:38:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>de Clari M.D.</p></p><p><p><img
