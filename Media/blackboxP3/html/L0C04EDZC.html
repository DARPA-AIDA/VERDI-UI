and Kashmir more sovereignty than any other Indian state.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) has expressed concern over the worsening situation in Indian-administered Kashmir.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 144 prohibits the movement of people and all educational institutions in the valley have also been closed.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In India, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s government has announced that it is terminating its special status and powers given to Kashmir under the Indian constitution.India’s Home Minister, Amit Shah on Monday proposed the abolition of Article 370, signed by the President in the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) (the upper house of the Indian parliament), which has given Kashmir a semi-autonomous body.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kashmir is the northernmost geographical region of the Indian subcontinent.Until the mid-19th century, the term 'Kashmir' denoted only the Kashmir Valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal Range.Today, it denotes a larger area that includes the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir (which includes the divisions Jammu, Kashmir Valley, and Ladakh), the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 370 of the Indian Constitution gave Jammu and Kashmir more sovereignty than any other Indian state, and it is the same clause on which this state joined India.Jammu and Kashmir will be reorganized as per a proposal presented by Parliament.After the elimination of Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir will become a Union Territory with its own Legislative Assembly.And there will be a Lieutenant-Governor while the Ladakh center will be an area where there will be no assembly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rajya Sabha has come under intense reaction from the opposition and in Kashmir for this decision.Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad from Kashmir said in the House: 'We will sacrifice our lives to protect the Constitution of India.'We oppose it.Today, the BJP has killed this constitution.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Former India-based Kashmir Chief Minister and PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti said in his tweet following the announcement, 'Today is the darkest day in India’s democracy.'He said that in 1947, the leadership of Jammu and Kashmir rejected the two-party ideology and the decision to affiliate with India.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The unilateral elimination of Article 370 by the Indian government is illegal and unconstitutional, which will make India a power in Jammu and Kashmir.'In another tweet, he wrote, ‘This move will have devastating effects on the subcontinent.The intentions of the Indian government are clear; they want to achieve the Jammu and Kashmir area by frightening the people here.India has failed on promises made with Kashmir.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) has expressed concern over the worsening situation in Indian-administered Kashmir and called on the international community to play its role in resolving the Kashmir issue.In a tweet, the OIC expressed great concern over the deteriorating situation in the Indian-administered Kashmir, including the deployment of paramilitary forces and the targeted bombing of civilians by the Indian Army.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither India nor Pakistan has formally recognised the accession of the areas claimed by the other.India claims those areas, including the area 'ceded' to China by Pakistan in the Trans-Karakoram Tract in 1963, are a part of its territory, while Pakistan claims the entire region excluding Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract.The two countries have fought several declared wars over the territory.The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 established the rough boundaries of today, with Pakistan holding roughly one-third of Kashmir, and India one-half, with a dividing line of control established by the United Nations.The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 resulted in a stalemate and a UN-negotiated ceasefire.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 370 of the Indian Constitution deals with the transitional administrative structure and this article gives the state of Jammu and Kashmir a special semi-autonomous status in the Indian Union.Under this, the State of Jammu and Kashmir had a special place and provisions within the Indian Constitution that apply to other states could not apply to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.Indian law could not be applied without the approval of the Central Government or the State Government in the Parliamentary State, in matters other than defense, communication and foreign affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Article 360 ​​of the Indian Constitution, the federal government can impose financial emergency in any state or across the country, but under Article 370, the Indian government was not allowed in Jammu and Kashmir.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in Kashmir had been strained for a few days before the Bharatiya Janata Party’s move, and thousands of additional troops have been deployed in the Indian Valley before the announcement.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 144 is enforced in the valley, while authorities have detained National Conference leader Omar Abdullah, beloved Mufti of the Peoples Democratic Party and Sajjad Lone, president of the Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference.Section 144 prohibits the movement of people and all educational institutions in the valley have also been closed.In addition, mobile phone and Internet service have also been shut down in Kashmir Valley, including Srinagar.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party President Mehbooba Mufti expressed his distress in one of his tweets, writing: 'This night is going to be too long, it is not going to be tomorrow.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:
