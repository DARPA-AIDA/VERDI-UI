cheap, easy, built in control, and tests for both recent (days to a week or so) and more remote (more than 7–10 days) antibodies to the disease.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longer answer: This is something that I’ve been looking for for over a month now.while it does not give fully quantitative results, in and of itself, it gives us an ability to screen for three categories with sufficient speed, sensitivity, and specificity for mas</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of investigation undertaken for diagnosing the COVID-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This test detects genetic material of the virus using a lab technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Also called a PCR test, a health care worker collects fluid from a nasal or throat swab.Results may be available in minutes if analyzed onsite or one to two days if sent to an outside lab.Molecular tests are considered very accurate when properly performed by a health care professional.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This newer COVID-19 test detects certain proteins that are p</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two broad types of 'CoVID-19 testing kit' in existence, and multiple labs are working on variants of each type:</p><p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qPCR, which selects and amplifies specific sections of genetic material (RNA, in the case of an ssRNA virus like SARS-CoV-2) if they are present in the sample.These can - in principle - detect even a single virus in the sample, but can only tell you if the viral RNA is present in that sample right now - in other words, it can confirm whether or not you are currently infected but can’t tell you if you’ve had the disease in the past, or whether</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapid COVID-19 Laser test is claimed to be a more quick and efficient way of conducting tests for COVID-19</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test is a recent innovation by QuantLase a UAE based research lab and will most probably be available in markets in a couple of months.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of this laser testing kit is based on the basic concept of optics, diffraction of light and interference,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a laser light is passed through blood cells a diffraction pattern is observed,</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key thing to note is that when cells are infected the shape of the blood cells change</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that if a laser light is passed through the blood of an i</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the extremely rapid — some as quick as 5 minutes — tests are antibody tests, which can tell if you’ve been infected for a while, and the virus has incubated, but cannot tell the difference between if you’ve been cleared of the virus, or if you are still carrying the virus, and are merely an asymptomatic carrier capable of infecting other people.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'rapid' tests, as an example, the Cephied cartridge based test, take\ approximately 45 minutes to run, operate by detecting the virus itself, usually at multiple regions of the viral genome, using antigen attachment sites that are unique to t</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They work like any other rapid test does: it takes whole blood, serum, or plasma from a patient and has it react to antigen-dye conjugates that will promote the formation of a color band at the testing portion of the cassette if the amount of antibodies is at or above the concentration cutoff for the test to read positive.To put it simply, if your blood has produced IgG and/or IgM antibodies in enough quantities, the test will be positive.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because these tests are brand new and the FDA hasn't properly approved them (only under EUA), they should really only be used for research purposes</p><p></p><p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;n/a</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-04-21</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04APLN</p></body></html>
