that much of America’s wealth is being generated in blue districts.In particular, economic growth has been centered in major democratic strongholds like New York and California.And research by the Brookings Institution found there was a 'huge increase' in the number of Democrats who identified as a 'progressive' this election year — 44% in 2018, compared to 29% in 2016 and 26% in 2014.A lot of red states don’t have a big population, so politically, conservative values are overrepresented in the Senate.But, economically, progressives are capturing the majority of the income.'If you just do the math,' Galloway said, 'there’s a solid shareholder-driven business strategy in promoting and being very open about your progressive values.'From a purely economic perspective, it makes sense for marketing to speak to these progressive consumers first.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-09T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>gdrkn</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cali and NY are losing it's wealthy population bigtime right now to Florida, and Texas.The only money democrats have is money they have stolen from the tax payers, and money they get from Soros!</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-09T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By:

and the United Kingdom in the world's top economies.This fact aside I believe you're missing the point.It's not a state formula it's the nation's demographics.Even in solid red states the more populous areas tend to skew left.These are major businesses there only ideology is profit.The fact is they've done the math and your views are the minority views.In addition people hold extremely conservative views tend to be old and therefore not future customers.This combined with many being on fixed incomes makes the calculation quite understandable</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On:

can't even balance their own state budgets.They live off of federal subsidies every month unlike Blue States that not only can balance their own budgets, they can produce much of the Federal GDP.Ca alone produces 17% of GDP in this country.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in the state of Georgia alone, the main industry comes out of Atlanta that is now a liberal city and part of the reason that Trump lost in Georgia and why the state went Blue.These voter suppression bills are trying to change what is reality in these Red States.Why are they fighting who they are as a state?Why are they not just changing their policies to accomodate their own voters, instead of just plain cheating?That is not a good long-term strategy.You cannot fight reality!!</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Jk599</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really and if there is any migration, they are taking their progressive values with them.Ultimately, any red states they are moving to will be in danger of slowly turning blue.These people are bringing their progressive values with them.That is what happened with AZ and with Georgia.Red to Blue!!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Places like CA and NY have all the jobs and industry.Where are these people going to move to unless they are just plain retired?Red States just don't provide the kind of good paying jobs that Blue states have.They just don't know how to attract business and industry.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FYI, Blue states produce the GDP for this country.They don't steal money from any taxpayers.If fact, you need to realize that the RED states are the 'taker' states in this country.The Blue State are the givers and the RED states live off of government subsidies.They can't even produce enough revenue to balance their own budgets.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now where would you rather live??Blue states of course as that is where the jobs are.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-10T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>Jk599</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Demonrats received far more than did the

happen.</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-04-09T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>T F</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trumptards hate
