a dating show; an animated show, 'Little Ellen'; and a documentary series on inventors made in conjunction with the Albert Einstein estate.(In another deal, she recently signed a multiyear pact with Discovery to produce natural history documentaries and series.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public perception of Ms. DeGeneres started to change in July when BuzzFeed reported that several of the show’s former and current staff members said they had confronted 'racism, fear and intimidation' on the set.Several staff members also said producers had sexually harassed them.Warner Bros.investigated the workplace and found 'deficiencies.'Three high-level producers were fired, including Ed Glavin, an executive producer; Jonathan Norman, a co-executive producer; and Kevin Leman, the head writer.Ms. DeGeneres apologized to her staff before addressing her viewers in September.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some observers believe the accusations may have weakened Ms. DeGeneres’s relationship with her audience.The host built her show as an oasis from the outside world, a place of goofy dancing, light jokes, cash giveaways to surprised audience members and high-wattage celebrity guests.Several years ago, she adopted 'be kind' as her motto, in response to the suicide of Tyler Clementi, a gay college student who took his own life after being bullied.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Her brand is not just being fairly nice — it is ‘Be Kind,’' said Stephen Galloway, the dean of Chapman University’s Dodge College of film and media arts.'She’s chosen two words to stamp herself.You cannot have hypocrisy better defined than when you’ve chosen those two words to define yourself and everyone is seeing the opposite is true inside your show.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The reason the incident with the producers was such a difficult and perilous moment is it’s the first time where something surfaced to indicate that a family — Ellen’s own professional family — was dysfunctional,' he continued.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. DeGeneres referred to her motto in her on-air apology.'Being known as the Be Kind Lady is a tricky position to be in,' she said.'So let me give you some advice.If anyone is thinking of changing their title or giving yourself a nickname, do not go with the Be Kind Lady.'She added that she was indeed the cheerful person she appeared to be on television, but was also someone who experienced moments of sadness, anxiety and impatience.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to her daytime show, Ms. DeGeneres is also a prime-time star for NBC — and her show for that network, 'Ellen’s Game of Games,' also a Warner production, has lost 32 percent of its viewers this season, as well as 35 percent in the adult demographic important to advertisers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the complications affecting all talk shows during the pandemic, 'Ellen,' with its loss of 43 percent of its audience, has suffered a steeper decline than its rivals.'Dr.Phil' is down 22 percent, and 'The Kelly Clarkson' show has lost 26 percent of its viewers.Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest’s show has lost just 3 percent, and 'Tamron Hall' is down 9 percent.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. DeGeneres beat the odds to make her show a success.There is a television graveyard filled with the comics, actors, anchors and reality stars who have taken a crack at syndicated talk shows only to be yanked off the air because of low ratings.And when 'Ellen' premiered, she also had to overcome the hesitancy of affiliate managers who thought an openly gay person could not connect with the women who make up most of the daytime audience.Her quick wit and approachable manner earned her millions of fans and ultimately a plum late-afternoon slot in most markets.As recently as a few years ago, the show was drawing roughly three million viewers an episode.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Ms. DeGeneres fights through a loss in popularity, she has turned to celebrity friends to help her make the case that there is not much difference between the on-camera Ellen and the real Ellen.When Michelle Obama was a virtual guest last week, she spoke warmly about the time she went to Ms. DeGeneres’s house and they played a piano duet together.A video clip of the pair at the piano was shown.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another recent guest, Jennifer Garner, also appearing remotely, raced to her hotel room balcony at the host’s request to tell passers-by how much she adored Ms. DeGeneres.'I love her!'Ms. Garner shouted.'She’s kind!She’s a humanitarian!She loves animals!'</p><p><p><strong><i>Posted On: </i></strong>2021-03-22T00:00:00<br></p><p><strong><i>Posted By: </i></strong>John Koblin</p></p><p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CH3Y.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CH3Z.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/jpg/L0C04CH40.jpg' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><img src='http://localhost:8083/blackboxP3/png/L0C04CH3X.png' style='max-width: 480px;'/></p><p><strong>Content Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-03-22</p><p><strong>Download Date:</strong>&nbsp;2021-05-15</p><p><strong>Document ID:</strong>&nbsp;L0C04CH3V</p></body></html>
