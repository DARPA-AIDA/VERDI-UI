are still willing to grow China-US relations with goodwill and sincerity,' Wang, who is also a State Councilor, said</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noting the issues that have strained relations between the two countries, Wang said the challenges now posed to both sides are unprecedented in the history of US-Chinese relations.It is worrying that China-US relations are one of the most important bilateral relations in the world, he said, but they are currently facing the most serious challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He emphasized that China’s policy toward the United States had not changed, and that Beijing wanted to expand relations with Washington.He stressed that experts on both sides of the list would provide three lists to address some of the issues, and how the two countries would approach each other.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Some friends in the US might have become suspicious or even wary of a growing China,' Wang said.'I’d like to stress here again that China never intends to challenge or replace the US or have a full confrontation with the US.What we care most about is to improve the livelihood of our people.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added that the first list should address issues that are relevant to the international community, and that the two countries can work on it.The second list should include issues that are of the dispute between the two countries, and can be resolved through negotiations.The third suggested list should be considered for cases that cannot be resolved.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang stressed the importance of properly managing disputes and minimizing the harm of conflicts between the two countries.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China–United States relations refers to relations between China and the United States since the 18th century.The relationship between the two countries has been complex, and vary from positive to highly negative.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proximity to Each Other Through an Exchange</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Chinese Foreign Minister, only through negotiation and exchange of views can the fake news and rumors be eliminated, and dangerous mistakes be prevented.He also mentioned cooperation in the field of COVID-19 disease.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that the Chinese government has done a lot of damage to the United States and the world by preventing the release of important information about the new coronavirus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US president has called COVID-19 a 'Chinese virus,' and accused the World Health Organization of supporting Beijing’s 'secrecy.'He first cut off his country’s financial aid to the World Health Organization, then announced his formal withdrawal this week.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang has announced his country’s readiness to work with the United States to fight the virus, including the production of vaccines and drugs to treat COVID-19.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenges of the United States and China have been multifaceted and, in some cases, fundamental.This is especially true in relation to Hong Kong and Taiwan, and geopolitical and geoeconomic competition.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese government recently passed a new security law for Hong Kong and faced strong opposition from Washington.Political experts see the law as a move to restrict political freedoms in Hong Kong.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space id=4]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share on Facebook Tweet Follow

current global pandemic has further complicated it.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country is prone to floods and landslides, and is in the middle of its annual rainy season.</li></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy rains continue pounding Japan, causing deadly floods in the southern part of the country.The floods have triggered landslides that have destroyed homes and made roads impassable.As of Thursday the death toll had risen to 59 as search and rescue operations continue.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) is an agency of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.It is charged with gathering and providing results for the public in Japan that are obtained from data based on daily scientific observation and research into natural phenomena in the fields of meteorology, hydrology, seismology and volcanology, among other related scientific fields.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan’s Meteorological Agency has stated that the rains are expected to continue until July 12, and called for people living in low-lying area, as well as flood and landslides, to be extra vigilant.The Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga urged residents to use caution.'Disasters may happen even with little rain where ground has loosened from previous rainfall,' he said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the peak of the disaster, around 3.6 million people had been advised to evacuate, although half of the advisories had been lifted by Wednesday.One man said he just couldn’t leave his home.'I was told to run away and my neighbors all went, but I stayed,' he said.'I didn’t want my house to be washed away in my absence.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evacuation was not mandatory, but the current global pandemic has further complicated it.The social distancing measure has also limited access to the available shelters.One doctor said that people were hesitant to offer help for fear of the virus.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In past disasters, by the fourth day, we normally see relief efforts like people preparing meals.This time I am yet to see something like that,' the doctor said.The country has recorded more than 20,000 cases with almost 1,000 deaths.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of army troops, police and other rescue workers have been mobilized to help in the search and rescue mission in affected areas.However, the operations have been hampered by the heavy rains still pounding, landslides, flooding and disrupted communication.</p><p><figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wet season (sometimes called the rainy season) is the time of year when most of a region’s average annual rainfall occurs.The wet season is known by many different local names throughout the world.</figcaption></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency said that the roads blocked by landslides and the rising flood waters had barred access to areas that are hard hit, especially the southwestern region of Kumamoto, where 14 people are missing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kamikochi and Matsumoto, two tourist destinations in Nagana, hundreds of residents and visitors were stranded after flooding and mudslides blocked parts of the main roads connecting the two towns, which are major tourist sites.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another incident, a pickup truck was hit by a mudslide in Kagoshima, causing it to plunge into the ocean.Fortunately, its driver, who had a head injury, was airlifted.In the town of Oita, two brothers were pulled alive after a mudslide crashed their house.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country is prone to floods and landslides, and is in the middle of its annual rainy season.Japan is usually at a higher risk of heavy rains during early summer, whereby warm and wet air from the East China Sea flows into a seasonal rain.In 2018, more than 200 people died from heavy rains and flooding in the southwestern part of the country.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bsa_pro_ad_space
